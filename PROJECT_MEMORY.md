# FreePromptHub Project Memory

## What We Learned (DON'T REPEAT THESE MISTAKES)

### WRONG Approach:
- SQL Query Optimizer prompts
- Complex business frameworks
- Investment portfolio analyzers
- Technical jargon-heavy prompts
- Prompts for tech experts

### RIGHT Approach - What People ACTUALLY Want:
1. **Meal Planning** (#1 most searched)
2. **Budget Help** (survival, not investing)
3. **Job Search** (resumes, interviews)
4. **Fitness at Home** (no gym required)
5. **Difficult Conversations** (relationships, work)
6. **Parenting Help**
7. **Side Hustles** (quick money)
8. **Organization** (decluttering)
