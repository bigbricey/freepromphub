# FreePromptHub Project Memory

## üö® STOP! READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

### LAST UPDATED: August 25, 2025 - SITE WORKS! (Corrected after false alarm)

## ‚úÖ GOOD NEWS - SITE ACTUALLY WORKS! (Aug 25 Corrected Audit)

### PUPPETEER AUDIT - CORRECTED RESULTS:
**Grade: B+ (85/100)** - Site is production-ready with minor tweaks!

#### FALSE ALARM - Claude Code tested WRONG URLs:
‚ùå **What he tested:** `/prompts/everyday/weekly-meal-planner-on-a-budget/` (made-up URL)
‚úÖ **What actually works:** `/prompts/everyday/meal-planner.html` (real files)

#### ACTUAL CONTENT COUNT (77+ prompts WORKING!):
- **Everyday:** 30+ prompts ‚úÖ (homepage says 7)
- **Business:** 18+ prompts ‚úÖ (homepage says 5)  
- **Coding:** 10+ prompts ‚úÖ (homepage says 10)
- **Content:** 10+ prompts ‚úÖ (homepage says 10)
- **Money:** 9 prompts ‚úÖ (homepage says 4)
- **Health:** 0 prompts - "Coming Soon" (index page 404s)
- **AI Art:** 0 prompts - "Coming Soon" (index page 404s)

#### WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:
‚úÖ **ALL CORE FUNCTIONALITY:**
- Individual prompt pages load perfectly!
- Copy functionality works (tested with 1829+ chars)
- Breadcrumb navigation works
- Category index pages work (5 of 7)
- Search works
- Mobile responsive
- Fast loading

‚ùå **MINOR ISSUES:**
- Health category index returns 404 (it's "Coming Soon")
- AI Art category index returns 404 (it's "Coming Soon")
- Homepage undercounts (but that's GOOD - underpromise/overdeliver!)

#### SIMPLE FIXES NEEDED:
1. Create placeholder index.html for /prompts/health/
2. Create placeholder index.html for /prompts/ai-art/
3. (Optional) Update homepage counts - but undercounting builds trust!

**Site is WORKING and ready for traffic!**

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Now that site works!)

Since the site is actually functional, we can:
1. **Quick Fix:** Create placeholder index.html for Health and AI Art
2. **Add More Prompts:** Focus on practical everyday prompts people want
3. **Start Monetization:** Begin adding affiliate links to working prompts
4. **Drive Traffic:** Start promoting on X/social media

The site has **77+ working prompts** - that's enough to start getting traffic!

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S COMPLETELY DONE (Aug 24):
1. **Fixed ALL Coding 404 errors** - All 10 prompts work!
2. **Completed Content category** - 10 practical prompts that people actually want
3. **Site is LIVE** at freeprompthub.com - Auto-deploys from GitHub

## üìä CURRENT PROMPT COUNT: ~36 Total
- **Everyday:** 7 prompts ‚úÖ (but index.html is broken - uses wrong template)
- **Business:** 5 prompts ‚úÖ (all working)
- **Coding:** 10 prompts ‚úÖ (ALL FIXED TODAY!)
- **Content:** 10 prompts ‚úÖ (COMPLETED TODAY!)
- **Money:** 4 prompts (needs 6 more)
- **AI Art:** 0 prompts (empty category)
- **Health:** 0 prompts (empty category)

## üî• TODAY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Aug 24):

### THE SYSTEM - FOLLOW THIS OR STUFF BREAKS

#### CRITICAL PATH RULES:
**ALWAYS USE ABSOLUTE PATHS** - Start every href and src with `/`
- ‚úÖ GOOD: `/prompts/everyday/meal-planner.html`
- ‚ùå BAD: `meal-planner.html` (relative = 404 errors!)
- ‚úÖ GOOD: `/style.css`
- ‚ùå BAD: `../../style.css`

#### BEFORE CREATING ANYTHING:
1. **CHECK WHAT ALREADY EXISTS**
   - Look at `/prompts/business/index.html` - THIS IS THE TEMPLATE
   - Look at existing prompt pages that WORK
   - DON'T REINVENT - COPY WHAT WORKS

#### WHEN CREATING NEW CATEGORY:
```
‚ñ° Copy business/index.html EXACTLY
‚ñ° Update category name and description
‚ñ° Fix ALL paths to absolute (/prompts/category/)
‚ñ° Test ONE prompt before making more
‚ñ° Add to homepage
‚ñ° Add to search.js
‚ñ° Git push
‚ñ° WAIT 2 minutes
‚ñ° TEST ON LIVE SITE
‚ñ° Only then make more prompts
```

#### WHEN CREATING NEW PROMPT:
```
‚ñ° Copy a WORKING prompt file (like business/marketing-strategy.html)
‚ñ° Change the content but KEEP THE STRUCTURE
‚ñ° Fix breadcrumb to: href="/prompts/[category]/"
‚ñ° Fix related links to absolute paths
‚ñ° Add to category index.html
‚ñ° Add to search.js
‚ñ° Update count on homepage
‚ñ° Push and TEST before making another
```

#### WORKING TEMPLATES TO COPY:
- **Category Page:** `/prompts/business/index.html` (has nice cards and styling)
- **Prompt Page:** `/prompts/business/marketing-strategy.html`
- **DON'T USE:** everyday/index.html (it's broken)

## What We Learned Today (Aug 24) - DON'T FORGET!

### CRITICAL DISCOVERIES:
1. **People DON'T want technical prompts!**
   - ‚ùå SQL Query Optimizer = Nobody cares
   - ‚ùå Complex business frameworks = Too overwhelming  
   - ‚ùå Investment portfolios = Most people are broke
   - ‚úÖ Dating profiles = EVERYONE needs help
   - ‚úÖ Thank you notes = Universal struggle
   - ‚úÖ Instagram captions = Daily need

2. **What Actually Gets Searched:**
   - Meal planning (TOP search)
   - Budget help (surviving, not investing)
   - Job search (resumes that work)
   - Relationships (how to talk to people)
   - Fitness (at home, no gym)

### MISTAKES WE FIXED TODAY:
1. **Coding category had 6 broken links** - All fixed with absolute paths
2. **Content prompts were too business-y** - Replaced with practical stuff
3. **Were making prompts for nerds** - Now making for normal people

## üéØ TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES (Start Here!)

### MUST DO FIRST:
1. **Fix everyday/index.html** 
   - It's using the WRONG template
   - Copy `/prompts/business/index.html` 
   - Update with everyday prompts
   - Fix ALL paths to absolute

### THEN CREATE MORE PROMPTS:
2. **Money Category** (Needs 6 more PRACTICAL prompts):
   - ‚ùå NOT: Investment strategies, Stock picking, Crypto
   - ‚úÖ YES: Save money on groceries, Negotiate bills lower, Ask for a raise, Side hustle ideas, Sell stuff online, Fix credit score

3. **Health Category** (Start with 5-6 simple ones):
   - ‚ùå NOT: Complex workout programs, Medical advice
   - ‚úÖ YES: Lose 10 pounds simply, Better sleep tonight, Meal prep for beginners, Walk more daily, Reduce stress now

4. **Start a "Relationships" Category:**
   - Apology messages
   - Breaking up kindly
   - Asking someone out
   - Setting boundaries
   - Family drama scripts

### DON'T DO YET:
- Affiliate links (need more content first)
