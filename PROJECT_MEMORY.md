## üö® LAST UPDATED: August 27, 2025 10:25 PM

## üìä CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
**Site is PARTIALLY FIXED but still needs work**

### What's Fixed ‚úÖ

4. **Site design** - COMPLETELY REDESIGNED based on 3 AI reviews
   - Added sticky header with navigation
   - Added hero section with trust signals

3. **Wrong affiliate products** - Weight loss coffee on coding pages, brain products on business pages
4. **No individual prompt pages** - Just category listings

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING

### URGENT - Site doesn't actually work:
1. **Create actual prompt pages** - The audit found there are NO individual prompt pages
2. **Add copy buttons** - People can't copy prompts
3. **Fix affiliate products** - Match products to categories:
   - Business ‚Üí Business tools
   - Coding ‚Üí Programming courses
   - Content ‚Üí Writing tools
   - Health ‚Üí Health products
   - Money ‚Üí Finance tools

### This Week:
1. Create all 54 individual prompt pages with actual prompts
2. Add working copy buttons
3. Realign all affiliate products
4. Add email capture
5. Create blog content

## üí∞ AFFILIATE SITUATION
**Current:** Products randomly placed, don't match categories
**Needed:** Realign from FINAL_all_affiliates_master.md:
- TedsWoodworking ‚Üí DIY/Hobby pages
- Java Burn ‚Üí Health pages
- Genius Wave ‚Üí Learning/Brain pages
- ProDentim ‚Üí Health pages
- Puravive ‚Üí Weight loss pages
