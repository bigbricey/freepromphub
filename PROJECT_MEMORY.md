## üìä DESIGN REVIEW CONSENSUS (from 3 AIs)
**All 3 AIs agreed the site looks "template-y" and unprofessional**

Top fixes they ALL mentioned:
1. Add proper header with navigation and CTA button (not just title)
2. Modernize cards - remove boxy borders, add shadows/elevation
3. Add trust signals - disclosure, testimonials, "Updated weekly"
4. Fix accessibility - better focus states, ARIA labels
5. Make "Coming Soon" non-clickable

**Created new files:**
- `style_new.css` - Modern design with CSS variables, shadows, sticky header
- `index_new.html` - Proper header, hero section, trust signals, disclosure

**User needs to decide:** Replace current files with new ones or keep current?
