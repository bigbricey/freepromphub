                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me write a dating profile that gets quality matches and shows who I really am.

ABOUT ME:
Age: [Your age]
Gender & Orientation: [How you identify]
Looking for: [Relationship / Casual / Not sure yet]
Job/Career: [What you do]
Location: [City]
Height: [If you want to include]

MY PERSONALITY:
Three words friends would use: [Examples]
Hobbies/Interests: [What you actually do, not generic stuff]
Ideal weekend: [Be specific]
Dealbreakers: [What you won't compromise on]
What makes me different: [Your unique thing]

Create profiles for different apps:

1. BUMBLE/HINGE BIO (Relationship-focused)
- 300-500 characters
- Show personality + values
- Conversation starters built in
- Hint at what dating you is like
- End with something intriguing

2. TINDER BIO (Shorter, punchier)
- 100-200 characters
- Witty or intriguing
- Stand out from the crowd
- No clichés (no "love to laugh")
- Leave them wanting more

3. DETAILED PROFILE (Match, OkCupid)
Opening paragraph:
- Hook that shows personality
- What you're actually like
- Authentic, not trying too hard

What I'm doing with my life:
- Career but make it interesting
- Passions beyond work
- Current goals or projects

What I'm looking for:
- Type of relationship
- Qualities that matter (specific)
- What you offer in return
- Deal breakers said positively

Perfect first date:
- Specific but flexible
- Shows your style
- Conversation-friendly
- Not dinner and a movie

4. PROMPT ANSWERS (Hinge style)
"Two truths and a lie":
[Make it interesting and revealing]

"I'm looking for someone who":
[Specific but not demanding]

"Dating me is like":
[Clever comparison]

"Biggest risk I've taken":
[Shows character]

"We'll get along if":
[Compatibility hints]

5. PHOTO CAPTION IDEAS
- Caption for main photo
- Activity photo caption
- Group photo context
- Pet photo line
- Travel photo hook

AVOID THESE CLICHÉS:
- "Love to laugh" (everyone does)
- "Work hard play hard"
- "Looking for my partner in crime"
- "I don't take myself too seriously"
- "Fluent in sarcasm"
- "Jim to my Pam" references
- Listing countries like achievements
- "Swipe left if..." negativity

INCLUDE THESE ELEMENTS:
- Specific details (name the book, not "I read")
- Humor that shows intelligence
- Values without preaching
- Interesting contradiction
- Conversation hooks
- Show, don't tell personality

Make it:
- Sound like me talking, not a resume
- Interesting to my target match
- Easy to message about
- Positive but real
- Unique but not trying too hard

Also suggest:
- What photos work best
- Best order for prompts/sections
- Red flags to avoid
- How to update seasonally</textarea>
