                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me write a complaint email that actually gets results.

THE PROBLEM:
Company: [Company name]
What happened: [Describe the issue clearly]
When it happened: [Date/timeframe]
Order/Reference number: [If applicable]
Previous attempts to resolve: [Phone calls, chats, etc.]
Money involved: [$Amount if relevant]

WHAT I WANT:
Desired outcome: [Refund / Replacement / Apology / Fix / Credit]
Deadline needed by: [If time-sensitive]
Acceptable alternatives: [If flexible]

Write 3 versions:

1. FIRM BUT PROFESSIONAL
Subject line that gets opened

Opening:
- Reference order/account number
- State problem clearly in first sentence
- No small talk or padding

The situation:
- Timeline of what happened
- Impact on me (cost time/money/inconvenience)
- What should have happened
- Previous attempts to resolve

What I want:
- Specific request (not vague)
- Reasonable deadline
- What happens if not resolved

Closing:
- Professional but serious
- Next steps if no response
- Contact information

2. ESCALATION VERSION (if first attempt failed)
Subject: URGENT: Unresolved Issue - [Reference Number]

Stronger opening:
- "I'm disappointed that..."
- Reference previous attempts
- Time wasted so far

Documentation:
- List all previous contacts (dates, names)
- Quote any promises made
- Attach evidence if relevant

Demands (not requests):
- Clear deadline (specific date)
- Mention consumer rights if relevant
- Reference social media/reviews
- CC relevant departments

Closing:
- "I expect resolution by [date]"
- Mention next steps (chargeback, BBB, etc.)
- Still professional but very firm

3. SOCIAL MEDIA VERSION (Twitter/Facebook)
Public post that gets attention:
- @mention the company
- Brief problem description
- Include photo if relevant
- Ask for help publicly
- Use relevant hashtags

Keep it:
- Factual, not emotional
- Short enough to read quickly
- Serious enough to get action

POWER PHRASES TO INCLUDE:
- "This is unacceptable"
- "I expect immediate action"
- "As a loyal customer of X years..."
- "This has caused significant inconvenience"
- "I'm prepared to take this further"
- "I require resolution within 48 hours"
- "This violates your stated policy of..."

AVOID THESE MISTAKES:
- Being abusive or threatening
- Writing when angry (sounds unhinged)
- Making it too long (they won't read)
- Being vague about what you want
- Empty threats you won't follow through
- Apologizing or being too nice
- Rambling life stories

INCLUDE THESE:
- Specific dates and times
- Names of people you spoke with
- Reference numbers/order numbers
- Screenshots or photos attached
- Relevant consumer law (if applicable)
- Your contact information clearly

EFFECTIVE SUBJECT LINES:
- "Urgent: Unresolved Issue Requiring Management Attention"
- "Request for Immediate Refund - Order #[Number]"
- "Formal Complaint: [Brief Issue] - Account #[Number]"
- "Day [X] Without Resolution - Escalation Required"

If relevant, mention:
- How long you've been a customer
- Money spent with them historically
- Impact on your business (if B2B)
- Comparison to competitors
- Documentation you have
- Regulatory bodies you'll contact

Also create:
- Follow-up template if no response
- Phone script if calling
- Chargeback request template
- Review templates that get attention</textarea>
