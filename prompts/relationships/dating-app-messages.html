                <h2>Dating App Messages That Actually Get Responses</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">"Hey" gets ignored. "You're beautiful" is creepy. Pickup lines are cringe. So what DO you say? This prompt helps you write opening messages that stand out, start real conversations, and actually lead to dates. Works for Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or any dating app.</p>

                <div class="prompt-box">
                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>
                    <div class="copy-wrapper">
                        <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy Prompt</button>
                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need help writing dating app messages that get responses. Here's the context:

THE APP: [Tinder/Bumble/Hinge/Coffee Meets Bagel/Other]
THEIR PROFILE INFO:
- Photos show: [what you noticed - activities, places, style]
- Bio says: [key points from their bio]
- Prompts mention: [for Hinge - their prompt answers]
- Interests listed: [music, hobbies, etc.]
- Potential red/green flags: [if any]

MY STYLE: [funny/serious/intellectual/playful/straightforward]
MY GOAL: [casual dating/relationship/just seeing what happens]

Create 5 different opening messages that:

1. Reference something SPECIFIC from their profile (not generic)
2. Ask an engaging question they'll want to answer
3. Show personality without trying too hard
4. Are 2-3 sentences max (short but substantial)
5. Don't comment on physical appearance
6. Avoid interview questions ("what do you do?")
7. Skip pickup lines and "clever" wordplay

For each message, include:
- The opener
- Why it works
- What kind of response to expect
- How to follow up if they respond

Also give me:
- Universal openers for profiles with minimal info
- How to restart dead conversations
- When to suggest meeting up (and how)
- Red flags in their responses
- Common mistakes to avoid

Make the messages:
- Genuinely interested, not desperate
- Confident but not arrogant
- Unique but not weird
- Flirty but not sexual
- Fun but not trying too hard

Include what to do if:
- They respond with one word
- They match but don't message (Bumble)
- The conversation dies after a few messages
- They're slow to respond</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most dating app messages fail because they're either too generic ("hey beautiful") or trying too hard to be clever. This prompt creates messages that feel like starting a conversation with someone interesting at a party - natural, engaging, and specific to them.</p>
                    <p>The key is showing you actually looked at their profile (instant differentiation) while keeping things light and giving them something easy to respond to.</p>

                    <h3>Message Strategy That Works:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sunday evening = best time:</strong> Most active users, highest response rates</li>
                        <li><strong>Question > Statement:</strong> Give them something to respond to</li>
                        <li><strong>Specific > Generic:</strong> "Your Japan photos!" beats "Love travel"</li>
                        <li><strong>Move fast:</strong> Suggest meeting within 10-15 messages</li>
                        <li><strong>Two message rule:</strong> If they don't respond to two messages, unmatch and move on</li>
                        <li><strong>Voice note test:</strong> If you wouldn't say it out loud, don't type it</li>
                        <li><strong>Match their energy:</strong> Long responses to long, short to short</li>
