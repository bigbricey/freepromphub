                <h2>First Date Ideas That Don't Suck (And Actually Lead to Second Dates)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">Dinner and a movie? Boring. Coffee? Job interview vibes. Netflix and chill? Way too presumptuous. This prompt helps you plan first dates that are actually fun, encourage real conversation, and give you both an easy out if there's no chemistry. No more awkward silences over overpriced pasta.</p>

                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>
                    <div class="copy-wrapper">
                        <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy Prompt</button>
                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need first date ideas that actually work. Here's the context:

HOW WE MET: [dating app/mutual friends/work/randomly in person]
WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THEM: [interests, job, lifestyle from profile/conversations]
OUR VIBE SO FAR: [flirty/intellectual/playful/reserved]
MY CITY/AREA: [urban/suburban/rural, climate, what's available]
BUDGET: [trying to impress/normal/broke but creative]
TIME OF DAY: [daytime/evening/weekend/after work]
MOBILITY: [both have cars/public transit/one car/walking distance]
COMFORT LEVEL: [meeting for first time/already know each other]

Create first date ideas that:

1. Allow conversation (not a movie/concert)
2. Have a natural time limit (easy to extend or end)
3. Take pressure off (activity-based, not just staring at each other)
4. Show personality (not generic)
5. Have a backup plan (weather, venue closed, etc.)
6. Feel safe (public, easy to leave)

Give me 5 different date ideas including:
- The specific plan
- Why it works psychologically
- Conversation starters for that activity
- How to suggest it confidently
- Backup if they don't like it
- How to extend if going well
- How to end gracefully if not
- What to wear (activity appropriate)

Categories to consider:
- Active but not sweaty (mini golf, bowling, arcade)
- Creative (pottery, painting, cooking class)
- Casual exploration (farmers market, museum, bookstore)
- Unique to my area (local attractions)
- Seasonal options
- Free/cheap options that don't look cheap

For each idea include:
- Best for what type of person
- Red flags to watch for
- Green lights to notice
- How to make it memorable
- Follow-up text after

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Too long (trapped if no chemistry)
- Too expensive (pressure/expectations)
- Too intimate (home cooking first date)
- Too group-oriented (friends around)
- Too passive (no interaction)
- Too competitive (unless they're into that)

Special considerations:
- If they don't drink
- Dietary restrictions
- Social anxiety
- Physical limitations
- Different energy levels</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>

This prompt generates ideas that let personality shine through shared experiences, with built-in escape routes if needed and extension possibilities if the chemistry is real.</p>
