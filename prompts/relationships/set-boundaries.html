                <h2>Set Healthy Boundaries (Without Feeling Like a Jerk)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">Tired of being everyone's doormat? Saying yes when you mean no? Feeling guilty for having needs? This prompt helps you set clear boundaries that protect your energy while maintaining relationships. No more resentment, no more burnout, no more being taken advantage of.</p>

                <div class="prompt-box">
                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>
                    <div class="copy-wrapper">
                        <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy Prompt</button>
                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need to set a boundary with someone and communicate it clearly. Here's my situation:

WHO WITH: [parent/partner/friend/coworker/boss/sibling/in-law/neighbor]
THE ISSUE: [what they keep doing that crosses your boundary]
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN HAPPENING: [days/weeks/months/years]
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS: [have you tried addressing it before? what happened?]
THEIR TYPICAL REACTION: [guilt trips/anger/dismissive/plays victim/ignores]
POWER DYNAMIC: [are they your boss/parent/someone you depend on?]
MY FEAR: [losing relationship/conflict/them hating me/looking mean]
WHAT I NEED: [specific boundary - what needs to stop/change]

Create multiple scripts for setting this boundary that:

1. State the boundary clearly without over-explaining
2. Don't JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain)
3. Use "I" statements, not accusations
4. Include consequences if boundary is crossed
5. Don't apologize for having boundaries
6. Stay calm even if they react badly

Give me:
- A firm but kind version
- A shorter, more direct version
- What to say if they push back
- How to handle guilt trips
- How to enforce consequences
- When to repeat vs. when to walk away

For ongoing relationships, include:
- How to maintain the boundary over time
- What to do when they test it
- How to not feel guilty
- Signs the boundary is working

Make the scripts:
- Confident without being aggressive
- Clear without being mean
- Firm without burning bridges (unless necessary)
- Appropriate for the relationship

Also help me identify:
- If this is a reasonable boundary
- If I'm being too nice or too harsh
- Whether this relationship is salvageable
- When to give up and cut contact</textarea>

                <section class="how-it-works">
                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most people fail at boundaries because they over-explain (giving the other person ammunition to argue) or deliver them as ultimatums. This prompt creates clear, calm statements that aren't up for negotiation while maintaining relationship potential.</p>
                    <p>It also prepares you for pushback - because boundary-crossers rarely accept limits without testing them first.</p>

                    <h3>Example Input:</h3>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>WHO:</strong> My mother</p>
                        <p><strong>ISSUE:</strong> Shows up at my house unannounced, lets herself in, criticizes my housekeeping</p>
                        <p><strong>HOW LONG:</strong> Years, worse since I moved closer</p>
                        <p><strong>PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS:</strong> Hinted she should call first, she ignored it</p>
                        <p><strong>HER REACTION:</strong> Guilt trips ("I'm your mother!"), plays victim</p>
                        <p><strong>POWER:</strong> No financial dependence but she babysits sometimes</p>
                        <p><strong>MY FEAR:</strong> Her telling family I'm ungrateful, losing babysitting help</p>
                        <p><strong>WHAT I NEED:</strong> Call before coming, knock and wait, no housekeeping comments</p>

                    <h3>Boundary-Setting Rules:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>You teach people how to treat you:</strong> Every time you don't enforce, you train them to ignore</li>
                        <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Practice with low-stakes boundaries first</li>
                        <li><strong>"No" is a complete sentence:</strong> You don't need to explain</li>
                        <li><strong>Boundaries are about YOUR behavior:</strong> "I will leave if..." not "You can't..."</li>
                        <li><strong>Expect extinction burst:</strong> Bad behavior gets worse before it gets better</li>
                        <li><strong>Document if needed:</strong> Keep records with toxic people or at work</li>
                        <li><strong>Your guilt is their weapon:</strong> They trained you to feel bad for having needs</li>
                    </ul>
