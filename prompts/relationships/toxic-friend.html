                <h2>Deal with Toxic Friends (Who Drain Your Energy and Test Your Patience)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">That friend who only calls when they need something? Who makes everything about them? Who leaves you feeling exhausted after every interaction? Yeah, them. This prompt helps you identify toxic patterns, set boundaries, and decide whether to fix the friendship or end it.</p>

                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need help dealing with a toxic friend. Here's the situation:

THEIR TOXIC BEHAVIOR: [only calls when they need something/constant drama/puts me down/competes with me/lies/gossips/never listens/jealous/manipulative]
HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS: [months/years/since childhood]
WHAT KEEPS ME STUCK: [history/guilt/mutual friends/work together/they have dirt on me/kids are friends]
HOW I FEEL AFTER SEEING THEM: [drained/anxious/angry/bad about myself/relieved when they leave]
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS: [have I tried talking to them? what happened?]
THEIR RESPONSE TO BOUNDARIES: [gets defensive/plays victim/threatens/ignores]
MUTUAL CONNECTIONS: [friend group/work/family/kids' school]
THE GOOD PARTS: [are there any? be honest]

Help me figure out:

1. Is this actually toxic or just difficult?
   - Red flags I'm seeing
   - Patterns to recognize
   - Gaslighting signs

2. Can this friendship be saved?
   - What would need to change
   - Is it worth the effort
   - Signs it's beyond repair

3. Scripts for different approaches:
   - Having an honest conversation
   - Setting specific boundaries
   - Slow fade vs direct ending
   - Dealing with mutual friends

4. How to handle their tactics:
   - Guilt trips ("after all I've done")
   - Playing victim to others
   - Spreading rumors
   - Love bombing to pull you back
   - Using your secrets against you

5. Practical steps for:
   - Reducing contact gradually
   - Grey rocking (being boring)
   - Information diet
   - Protecting mutual friendships
   - Social media boundaries

Give me exact phrases for:
- Declining invitations
- Ending phone calls
- Not engaging with drama
- Responding to manipulation
- Explaining to mutual friends

For my specific situation:
- Whether confrontation is safe/worth it
- Exit strategy if we're entangled
- Self-care during/after
- How to not feel guilty
- Warning signs I'm being hoovered back</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Toxic friendships are tricky because they usually didn't start toxic - there's history, good memories, and often genuine care mixed with harmful behavior. This prompt helps you see patterns clearly and gives you options beyond "just cut them off" (which isn't always possible).</p>
                    <p>It also prepares you for the manipulation tactics toxic people use when they feel you pulling away.</p>
