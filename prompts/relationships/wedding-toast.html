                <h2>Write a Perfect Wedding Toast (That Won't Haunt You on YouTube Forever)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">Being asked to give a wedding toast is an honor - and terrifying. You want to be funny but not offensive, heartfelt but not sappy, memorable but not infamous. This prompt helps you craft a toast that hits all the right notes without mentioning exes, drunk stories, or that Vegas incident.</p>

                <div class="prompt-box">
                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>
                    <div class="copy-wrapper">
                        <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy Prompt</button>
                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need to write a wedding toast. Here's my situation:

MY ROLE: [best man/maid of honor/parent/sibling/friend]
WHO I'M CLOSEST TO: [bride/groom/both/neither really]
HOW LONG I'VE KNOWN THEM: [years, how we met]
AUDIENCE: [small intimate/large formal/mixed ages/cultural considerations]
TONE THEY'D WANT: [funny/heartfelt/short and sweet/roast-style]
LENGTH: [2-3 minutes/5 minutes/quick blessing]
MY SPEAKING ABILITY: [confident/nervous/might cry/might freeze]

KEY STORIES/MEMORIES: [2-3 appropriate stories I could share]
THEIR RELATIONSHIP: [how they met, what I've observed]
WHAT I ADMIRE: [about them individually and as a couple]
INSIDE JOKES: [that others would understand]

Create a wedding toast that:

1. Opens strong (attention grabber that's appropriate)
2. Introduces myself and my connection
3. Shares 1-2 stories that:
   - Show character
   - Are wedding-appropriate
   - Others can relate to
   - Don't embarrass anyone
4. Transitions to the couple
5. Says something meaningful about their love
6. Ends with a clear toast moment

Include:
- Natural transition phrases
- Pause points for laughs/emotions
- Recovery lines if jokes don't land
- How to handle getting emotional
- Clear ending so people know when to drink

NEVER include:
- Exes or past relationships
- Drunk/drug stories
- "Ball and chain" jokes
- Inside jokes only 2 people get
- Anything sexual
- Backhanded compliments
- How you "never thought this day would come"

Give me:
- A full toast script
- A shorter backup version
- Opening lines if I blank
- How to practice
- What to do with my hands
- Whether to use notes/cards
- How to handle nervousness

For common situations:
- If I don't like their partner
- If I barely know one of them
- If their families don't get along
- If it's a second marriage
- If I might cry
- If I'm following a great toast
- If I've been drinking</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most wedding toasts fail because people try to be comedians or therapists. This prompt creates a balanced toast that celebrates the couple without roasting them, tells stories without oversharing, and shows emotion without sobbing into the microphone.</p>
                    <p>It also gives you backup plans for common wedding toast disasters - because Murphy's Law loves weddings.</p>

                    <h3>Wedding Toast Golden Rules:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The grandmother test:</strong> If grandma would clutch pearls, cut it</li>
                        <li><strong>One drink max before:</strong> Dutch courage becomes slurred words</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice out loud:</strong> 5 times minimum, time yourself</li>
                        <li><strong>Stand and deliver:</strong> Don't sit, project your voice</li>
                        <li><strong>Look at the couple:</strong> Not the crowd when nervous</li>
                        <li><strong>End clearly:</strong> "Please raise your glasses to..."</li>
                        <li><strong>3-minute rule:</strong> Shorter is always better than longer</li>
                        <li><strong>Phone off:</strong> Nothing worse than your ringtone mid-toast</li>
