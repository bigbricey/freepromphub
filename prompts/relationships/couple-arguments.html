                <h2>Fight Fair in Relationships (Without Destroying What You've Built)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">Every couple fights. The difference between couples who last and couples who don't isn't whether they argue - it's HOW they argue. This prompt helps you navigate conflicts without going nuclear, bringing up past sins, or saying things that leave permanent scars.</p>

                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>

                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need help resolving a conflict with my partner constructively. Here's the situation:

THE ISSUE: [money/chores/sex/time/family/communication/trust/future plans]
WHAT HAPPENED: [specific incident that triggered this fight]
MY FEELINGS: [hurt/angry/unheard/disrespected/taken for granted]
THEIR PERSPECTIVE: [what they'd probably say the issue is]
OUR PATTERN: [do we always fight about this? how does it usually go?]
FIGHT STYLE: [I shutdown/they yell/cold war/explosive/passive aggressive]
RELATIONSHIP LENGTH: [dating/engaged/married, how long]
LIVING SITUATION: [together/separate/have kids]
UNDERLYING ISSUE: [if I'm honest, what's this REALLY about?]

Help me approach this constructively:

1. How to bring it up:
   - Best time/place
   - Opening statement that doesn't attack
   - Setting ground rules for discussion

2. During the conversation:
   - "I feel" statements that work
   - How to really listen (not just wait to talk)
   - Staying on topic (not bringing up everything)
   - Managing emotions (yours and theirs)
   - When to take a break

3. Fair fighting rules:
   - What's off limits
   - How to fight about the issue, not each other
   - Avoiding the Four Horsemen (criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling)
   - Repair attempts that work

4. Finding resolution:
   - Compromise vs. understanding
   - Action items that stick
   - Preventing same fight repeatedly
   - When to get help

Scripts for common situations:
- "You always/never..."
- When they bring up past mistakes
- If they shut down
- If voices get raised
- If someone threatens to leave
- If tears start
- If it gets mean

Recovery after the fight:
- How to reconnect
- Repairing damage
- Preventing resentment
- Learning from it

Red flags this is bigger:
- When it's abuse, not conflict
- When to consider counseling
- When to consider leaving

Make the approach:
- Specific to our dynamic
- Focused on solving, not winning
- Preserving love and respect
- Building understanding</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most relationship fights escalate because people fight to win, not to understand. This prompt shifts focus from "proving you're right" to "solving the problem together." It recognizes that under most arguments is a deeper need not being met.</p>
                    <p>It also gives you actual scripts for when things get heated - because "just communicate" isn't helpful when you're both seeing red.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>One issue at a time:</strong> Don't bring up everything they've done wrong since 2019</li>
                        <li><strong>No name-calling:</strong> Attack the problem, not the person</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay present:</strong> "Right now I feel..." not "You always..."</li>
                        <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> "I need 20 minutes" when too heated</li>
                        <li><strong>No threats:</strong> Don't threaten divorce/breakup as weapon</li>
                        <li><strong>Listen to understand:</strong> Not to prepare your rebuttal</li>
                        <li><strong>Own your part:</strong> Even if it's 10% your fault</li>
                        <li><strong>Solutions focused:</strong> "How do we fix this?" not "You're wrong"</li>
