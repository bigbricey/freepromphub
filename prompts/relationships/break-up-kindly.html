                <h2>End a Relationship Respectfully (Without Being Cruel or Giving False Hope)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">Breaking up sucks. There's no way around that. But HOW you do it matters - for them, for you, and for your future peace of mind. This prompt helps you find words that are clear, kind, and final. No mixed signals, no false hope, no unnecessary cruelty.</p>

                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>
                    <div class="copy-wrapper">
                        <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy Prompt</button>
                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need to end my relationship respectfully and clearly. Here's my situation:

RELATIONSHIP LENGTH: [few weeks/months/years]
LIVING SITUATION: [live together/separate/long distance]
WHY I'M ENDING IT: [lost feelings/different life goals/incompatibility/met someone else/need to be alone/other]
THEIR AWARENESS: [they see it coming/will be blindsided/we've discussed problems]
THEIR ATTACHMENT: [more invested than me/equally ready/very in love]
SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES: [pets/lease/kids/business/mutual friends]
MY MAIN CONCERN: [hurting them/their reaction/seeing them after/guilt]
METHOD: [in person/phone/text - and why]

Create a breakup conversation/message that:

1. Is absolutely clear this is ending (no "breaks" or "maybe later")
2. Takes responsibility for my decision
3. Doesn't list their flaws or blame them
4. Doesn't give false hope about friendship
5. Addresses practical matters (if any)
6. Is kind but not so nice it sends mixed signals
7. Doesn't over-explain or justify
8. Allows them dignity in their response

Include:
- How to start the conversation
- The key points to cover
- What NOT to say (common mistakes)
- How to handle if they beg/cry/get angry
- How to end the conversation
- Follow-up boundaries to set

If we share friends/work/living space, include:
- How to handle immediate aftermath
- Boundaries for moving forward
- What to tell mutual friends

Make it:
- Clear and final
- Respectful of our history
- As kind as possible while being honest
- Not open to negotiation
- Focused on incompatibility, not fault

Also advise on:
- Best time/place to do it
- Whether to warn them "we need to talk"
- How much detail to give about reasons
- Whether to have their stuff ready (if applicable)
- Post-breakup contact rules</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most breakups go badly because people either drag it out trying to be "nice" (creating false hope) or get defensive and list every flaw (creating trauma). This prompt finds the middle ground: clear, kind, and conclusive.</p>
                    <p>It focuses on incompatibility rather than blame, which preserves everyone's dignity and reduces the chance of an explosive response.</p>

                        <p><strong>WHY:</strong> Different life goals - they want kids soon, I don't want kids ever</p>
                        <p><strong>THEIR AWARENESS:</strong> We've discussed the kid issue but they think I'll change my mind</p>

                        <p><strong>MAIN CONCERN:</strong> They'll think it's temporary or negotiable</p>

                    <h3>Breakup Rules to Follow:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Never on special days:</strong> Not their birthday, holidays, after a death, before big exams</li>
                        <li><strong>In person rule:</strong> Over 3 months = in person (unless abusive/long distance)</li>
                        <li><strong>Friday is worst:</strong> Ruins weekend. Sunday bad too. Tuesday is statistically best</li>
                        <li><strong>Private place:</strong> Their place ideal (they don't have to travel after), never public</li>
                        <li><strong>Have an exit:</strong> Don't do it if you're staying the night or trapped somewhere</li>
                        <li><strong>No breakup sex:</strong> Sends mixed signals, makes everything worse</li>
                        <li><strong>Block if needed:</strong> Sometimes no contact is kindest for everyone</li>
