                <h2>Handle Family Drama (Without Ruining Holidays or Your Sanity)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">Ah, family. Can't live with them, can't change your DNA. Whether it's your racist uncle at Thanksgiving, your mom's passive-aggressive comments about your life choices, or siblings fighting over money, this prompt helps you navigate family chaos while keeping your sanity intact.</p>

                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I need strategies to handle family drama. Here's my situation:

THE ISSUE: [politics/money/relationships/parenting/lifestyle/inheritance/favorites]
WHO'S INVOLVED: [parents/siblings/in-laws/extended family]
THE DYNAMIC: [what typically happens - yelling/guilt/silent treatment/ganging up]
UPCOMING EVENT: [holiday/wedding/funeral/birthday/regular visit]
MY USUAL ROLE: [peacekeeper/scapegoat/invisible/fighter/mediator]
WHAT I CAN'T CHANGE: [living situation/financial dependence/custody/illness]
MY GOAL: [survive event/set boundaries/change dynamic/protect kids/keep peace]
SPECIFIC TRIGGERS: [topics/people/situations that always cause problems]

Create a survival plan that includes:

1. Pre-event preparation (mental and practical)
2. Scripts for common situations:
   - Shutting down political arguments
   - Deflecting personal attacks
   - Redirecting inappropriate questions
   - Protecting kids from adult issues
   - Dealing with drunk relatives
   - Handling money requests/discussions

3. In-the-moment strategies:
   - How to gray rock (be boring)
   - When to take breaks
   - Safe conversation redirects
   - Alliance building
   - Exit strategies

4. Boundary phrases that work with family:
   - Without causing huge fights
   - That respect hierarchy (if cultural)
   - For protecting your partner/kids
   - For information diet

Give me:
- Exact phrases for common situations
- Body language tips
- Where to sit/stay for easy exits
- How to handle "but we're family!"
- Post-event recovery plan
- When to go no-contact

For specific issues:
- If parents play favorites
- If they hate your partner
- If they criticize your parenting
- If they bring up old wounds
- If they guilt trip about visits/money

Make it:
- Culturally sensitive if needed
- Age-appropriate if kids involved
- Realistic (not everyone can just leave)
- Focused on survival, not fixing them</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Family dynamics are complex - there's history, hierarchy, and often financial or practical entanglements you can't just walk away from. This prompt acknowledges those realities while giving you actual tools to protect your mental health.</p>
                    <p>It focuses on what you CAN control (your responses) rather than trying to change people who've been the same for 40 years.</p>
