                <h2>Ask Someone Out (Without Being Weird or Creepy)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">That person you like? Time to actually do something about it. But "hey, wanna hang out sometime?" isn't going to cut it. This prompt helps you express interest confidently, suggest something specific, and handle any response with grace. No pickup lines, no games, just genuine connection.</p>

                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>
                    <div class="copy-wrapper">
                        <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy Prompt</button>
                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>I want to ask someone out in a confident, respectful way. Here's my situation:

HOW I KNOW THEM: [coworker/friend/gym/coffee shop/dating app/friend of friend/class]
HOW LONG I'VE KNOWN THEM: [just met/few weeks/months/years]
OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP: [strangers who smile/casual acquaintances/friends/flirty but unclear]
PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS: [what we usually talk about, any positive signals]
THEIR PERSONALITY: [outgoing/shy/funny/serious - what you've observed]
MY PERSONALITY: [so the approach matches who I am]
ASKING IN PERSON OR TEXT: [how I plan to ask]
MY ANXIETY LEVEL: [super nervous/somewhat confident/very confident]

Create multiple approaches for asking them out that:

1. Are clear about romantic interest (no ambiguous "hanging out")
2. Suggest a specific, low-pressure first date
3. Give them an easy out if they're not interested
4. Don't put them on the spot (especially if coworker/friend)
5. Include what to say if they say yes, no, or "maybe/I need to think"

Give me:
- A direct but warm approach
- A more casual/playful approach  
- What NOT to say (common mistakes)
- How to handle if I see them regularly after they say no
- Signs I should NOT ask (they're not interested/unavailable)

Make it:
- Confident without being cocky
- Clear without being aggressive
- Respectful of their right to say no
- Natural to my personality
- Appropriate for our dynamic

If texting, include:
- Best time to send it
- How long to wait for a response
- What to do if they don't respond

For in-person, include:
- How to bring it up naturally
- Body language tips
- How to recover if I get tongue-tied</textarea>

                <section class="how-it-works">
                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most people fail at asking someone out because they're either too vague ("we should hang out sometime") or too intense ("I've been in love with you for years"). This prompt finds the sweet spot: clear interest, specific plan, respectful approach.</p>
                    <p>It also prepares you for all three responses - yes, no, and maybe - so you're not caught off guard. Most importantly, it keeps things low-pressure so neither of you feels weird if it doesn't work out.</p>

                        <p><strong>PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS:</strong> We joke about both being there too much, they remember details from our convos, lots of smiling</p>
                        <p><strong>THEIR PERSONALITY:</strong> Friendly, bit shy, loves books (always reading)</p>
                        <p><strong>MY PERSONALITY:</strong> More introverted, dry humor, straightforward</p>

                    <h3>Pro Tips for Asking Someone Out:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Specific > Vague:</strong> "Would you like to get dinner Saturday?" beats "wanna hang out sometime?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Have a plan B location:</strong> If they don't like your first suggestion, have another ready</li>
                        <li><strong>No is a complete answer:</strong> Don't ask why, don't negotiate, just say "No worries!" and move on</li>
                        <li><strong>Thursday is the best day to ask:</strong> Not too eager (Monday), not last minute (Friday)</li>
                        <li><strong>One shot rule:</strong> If they say no or give vague excuses, don't ask again</li>
                        <li><strong>Watch for green lights:</strong> They text first, remember details, make time to talk, physical proximity</li>
                        <li><strong>Exit strategy:</strong> If you work/study together, make sure rejection won't make life awful</li>
