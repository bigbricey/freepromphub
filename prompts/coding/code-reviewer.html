You've reviewed thousands of pull requests and have expertise in security, performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Conduct a thorough code review of the following code. Be direct and specific - point out issues that could cause problems in production.

CODE TO REVIEW:
Language/Framework: [SPECIFY]
Purpose of Code: [WHAT THIS CODE DOES]
Context: [NEW FEATURE/BUG FIX/REFACTOR]

```[language]
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

Provide a comprehensive code review covering:

1. CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Merge)
For each critical issue:
- Line number: [Where the issue is]
- Issue: [What's wrong]
- Risk: [What could happen in production]
- Fix: [Exact code to replace it with]
```[language]
// Corrected code

2. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
- [ ] SQL Injection risks
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities  
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization flaws
- [ ] Data exposure risks
- [ ] Input validation issues
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities

For each vulnerability found:
- Vulnerability: [Type and location]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Attack scenario: [How it could be exploited]
- Fix:
```[language]
// Secure implementation
```

3. PERFORMANCE ISSUES
- [ ] O(n²) or worse algorithms
- [ ] Database N+1 queries
- [ ] Memory leaks
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders/computations
- [ ] Missing indexes
- [ ] Inefficient data structures

For each performance issue:
- Issue: [What's slow]
- Impact: [How much it affects performance]
- Optimization:
```[language]
// Optimized version

Architectural improvements:
```[language]
// Better architecture example
```

6. BEST PRACTICES VIOLATIONS
- Design pattern that should be used: [Pattern name]
- Better approach:
```[language]
// Best practice implementation
```

7. EDGE CASES NOT HANDLED
List edge cases the code doesn't handle:
- Edge case 1: [Description] - [What happens]
- Edge case 2: [Description] - [What happens]

How to handle them:
```[language]
// Edge case handling
```

8. REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS
Provide refactored version of the entire code:
```[language]
// Complete refactored code with all improvements
```

9. TESTING REQUIREMENTS
Unit tests that should be written:
```[language]
// Example test cases
test("should handle [scenario]", () => {
    // Test implementation
});
```

10. LEARNING POINTS
