                <h2>Ask for a Raise (Without Threatening to Quit or Making It Weird)</h2>
                
                <p class="intro">You're underpaid and you know it. But asking for more money feels like defusing a bomb - one wrong move and your job explodes. This prompt helps you build an airtight case, pick the perfect timing, and negotiate like someone who knows their worth - without ultimatums or awkwardness.</p>

                    <h3>The Prompt:</h3>

                        <textarea class="prompt-text" readonly>Help me ask for a raise strategically and professionally. Here's my situation:

CURRENT ROLE: [title, department, how long in position]
CURRENT SALARY: [salary/hourly, last raise when/how much]
TARGET RAISE: [percentage or amount I want]
COMPANY SITUATION: [doing well/struggling/just had layoffs/growing]
MY PERFORMANCE: [recent wins, achievements, metrics]
MARKET RESEARCH: [what similar roles pay elsewhere]
BOSS RELATIONSHIP: [great/okay/tense, their personality]
TIMING FACTORS: [review coming up/budget season/after big project]
LEVERAGE: [other offers/unique skills/flight risk]
CONCERNS: [why I'm nervous about asking]

Create a raise negotiation strategy including:

1. BUILDING MY CASE:
   - Quantifying my value (specific numbers/metrics)
   - Documenting achievements
   - Market rate research presentation
   - ROI I've delivered
   - Additional responsibilities I've taken
   - Problems I've solved
   - Money I've saved/earned company

2. TIMING THE ASK:
   - Best time of year
   - Best day/time to meet
   - After what accomplishments
   - Budget cycle considerations
   - Boss's mood indicators

3. THE CONVERSATION SCRIPT:
   - How to open
   - Presenting my case
   - The actual ask
   - Handling initial response
   - Negotiation tactics
   - Fallback positions
   - Closing strong

4. OBJECTION HANDLING:
   - "Not in the budget"
   - "Need to check with HR"
   - "You're already paid well"
   - "Everyone wants a raise"
   - "Bad timing"
   - "Need to see more"
   - Complete refusal

5. NEGOTIATION TACTICS:
   - Anchoring high
   - Silence as tool
   - Package deals (benefits + salary)
   - Timeline if not now
   - Performance triggers
   - Title changes

6. ALTERNATIVES TO MONEY:
   - More PTO
   - Remote days
   - Professional development
   - Equity/bonus structure
   - Flexible hours
   - Better projects

7. EMAIL TEMPLATES:
   - Meeting request
   - Follow-up after verbal yes
   - Follow-up after "let me think"
   - Putting agreement in writing
   - Thank you regardless

8. WHAT NOT TO DO:
   - Threats to leave (unless real)
   - Comparing to coworkers
   - Personal financial needs
   - Emotional appeals
   - Accepting verbal promises

For specific scenarios:
- If they say no
- If they lowball
- If they stall
- If they get angry
- If they counter-offer

Post-conversation:
- Getting it in writing
- Timeline for changes
- Next review date
- Relationship management</textarea>

                    <h3>Why This Prompt Works:</h3>
                    <p>Most people fail at raise negotiations because they make it about need instead of value, or they pick terrible timing. This prompt helps you approach it like a business case - with data, strategy, and multiple fallback positions so you win something even if you don't get everything.</p>
