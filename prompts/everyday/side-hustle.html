2. **SKILL ASSESSMENT**
Hidden skills I'm not seeing:
- Skills from my day job that others need
- Hobbies that could make money
- Problems I solve that others would pay for

7. **SAME-DAY STARTS**
3 hustles with ZERO preparation:

8. **LEVERAGE WHAT I HAVE**
Using my existing:
- Unused space (storage, parking, room)
- Unused time (commute, lunch, TV time)
- Unused stuff (tools, equipment, clothes)
- Unused knowledge (what seems obvious to me)

9. **SCALING STRATEGY**
Once I'm making some money:
- Which hustle to focus on
- How to increase rates
- How to get repeat customers
- When to drop what's not working

10. **EMERGENCY OPTIONS**
If I need money TODAY:
- Same-day payment gigs
- Items to sell fast
- Services with immediate demand
- Apps with instant cashout

11. **AVOIDING SCAMS**
Red flags to watch for:
- Phrases scammers use
- Legitimate vs fake opportunities
- Payment methods to avoid
- Too good to be true signs

12. **TAX REALITY CHECK**
- Set aside [%] for taxes
- What counts as business expense
- Simple tracking system
- When it matters

IMPORTANT: Focus on what I can do NOW, not perfect businesses for later. I need money this month, not a 5-year plan. Be specific with names of apps, websites, and exactly what to do first.</textarea>
