                    <label for="prompt-text" class="prompt-label">Prompt:</label>
                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>My [ROOM/CLOSET/GARAGE/ENTIRE HOUSE] is a complete disaster and I don't know where to start.

THE SITUATION:
Space: [BEDROOM/KITCHEN/GARAGE/OFFICE/ENTIRE APARTMENT]
Worst problems: [CLOTHES EVERYWHERE/PAPERS PILED UP/KIDS TOYS/TOOLS/EVERYTHING]
Why it's hard: [ADHD/NO TIME/KIDS MESS IT UP/DEPRESSION/OVERWHELMED/HATE CLEANING]
Time available: [X HOURS THIS WEEKEND / 15 MINUTES A DAY / RANDOM MOMENTS]
Help available: [DOING IT ALONE / PARTNER WILL HELP / KIDS CAN HELP A LITTLE]
Budget for supplies: $[AMOUNT - even if zero]

CREATE MY BATTLE PLAN:

1. **EMERGENCY 15-MINUTE FIX**
If someone's coming over in 15 minutes:
- What to grab first
- Where to shove things temporarily
- What makes biggest visual impact
- Quick surface cleaning priorities

2. **THE REAL PLAN - BROKEN INTO TINY STEPS**

Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (30 minutes)
- [ ] Step 1: [Specific 5-minute task]
- [ ] Step 2: [Next 5-minute task]
- [ ] Step 3: [Continue breaking it down]
[Continue with bite-sized tasks]

Phase 2: Sort the Chaos (1 hour in 15-min chunks)
- [ ] Create 4 piles: Keep, Donate, Trash, Relocate
- [ ] Section 1: [Specific area, like "top of dresser"]
- [ ] Section 2: [Next small area]
[Break entire space into small sections]

Phase 3: Organize What's Left
- [ ] Group similar items
- [ ] Assign homes for everything
- [ ] Label if necessary

3. **DECISION FATIGUE HELP**

Quick rules for common items:
- Clothes: Haven't worn in [timeframe] = DONATE
- Papers: [Simple sorting system]
- Kids toys: [Rotation system]
- Sentimental items: [One box rule]
- "Might need someday": [Reality check]

For each category:
- KEEP if: [Specific criteria]
- TOSS if: [Clear rules]
- DONATE if: [Guidelines]

4. **ADHD-FRIENDLY APPROACH**
- Body doubling alternatives
- Playlist timing (3 songs = 1 task)
- Reward system that works
- How to restart when distracted
- Visual progress tracking

5. **CHEAP/FREE ORGANIZATION**

Using what you have:

- Cardboard boxes: [DIY solutions]
- Repurpose containers: [Ideas]

Dollar store essentials ($20 total):
- [Specific items and uses]
- [Exactly what to buy]
- [What to skip]

6. **MAINTENANCE PLAN (So it doesn't happen again)**

Daily (2 minutes):

- Morning: [One quick task]

Weekly (10 minutes):
- [Specific reset routine]

Monthly (30 minutes):
- [Prevent re-accumulation]

The One Rule System:

7. **ROOM-BY-ROOM SPECIFICS**

For [MY SPACE TYPE]:
- Biggest problem area: [Solution]

- Common mistakes: [What not to do]

8. **MOTIVATION WHEN STUCK**

When overwhelmed:

- Before/after photo spot
- Text someone your progress

Can't start? Do this:
- Grab trash bag
- Walk around grabbing obvious trash
- That's it. You started.

9. **KEEPING IT REAL**

This WON'T be:
- Pinterest perfect
- Done in one day
- Permanently fixed
- Requiring expensive systems

This WILL be:
- Functional
- Maintainable
- Good enough
- Better than now

10. **FAMILY/ROOMMATE CHALLENGES**

If others mess it up:
- Designated mess zones
- "Dump baskets" for each person
- 5-minute family pickup time
- Natural consequences system

11. **DONATION/TRASH LOGISTICS**

Getting rid of stuff:
- Where to donate: [Local options]
- Free pickup services: [Who offers]
- Bulk trash days: [How to find]
- Selling valuable items: [Quick methods]
- Hazardous disposal: [Electronics, paint, etc.]

12. **PROGRESS TRACKING**

Week 1: [Realistic goal]
Week 2: [Build on success]
Week 3: [Almost there]
Week 4: [Maintenance mode]

Celebrate when:
- One surface stays clear for 3 days
- You can find things
- Someone comments it looks better
- You don't dread coming home

BE HONEST: I know I won't become a neat freak. I just need it functional and not embarrassing. Make this work for my real life, not some fantasy version of me.</textarea>
