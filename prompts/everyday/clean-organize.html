                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>My [ROOM/CLOSET/GARAGE/ENTIRE HOUSE] is a complete disaster and I don't know where to start.

THE SITUATION:
Space: [BEDROOM/KITCHEN/GARAGE/OFFICE/ENTIRE APARTMENT]
Worst problems: [CLOTHES EVERYWHERE/PAPERS PILED UP/KIDS TOYS/TOOLS/EVERYTHING]
Why it's hard: [ADHD/NO TIME/KIDS MESS IT UP/DEPRESSION/OVERWHELMED/HATE CLEANING]
Time available: [X HOURS THIS WEEKEND / 15 MINUTES A DAY / RANDOM MOMENTS]
Help available: [DOING IT ALONE / PARTNER WILL HELP / KIDS CAN HELP A LITTLE]
Budget for supplies: $[AMOUNT - even if zero]

CREATE MY BATTLE PLAN:

- [ ] Step 3: [Continue breaking it down]
[Continue with bite-sized tasks]

Phase 2: Sort the Chaos (1 hour in 15-min chunks)
- [ ] Create 4 piles: Keep, Donate, Trash, Relocate
- [ ] Section 1: [Specific area, like "top of dresser"]
- [ ] Section 2: [Next small area]
[Break entire space into small sections]

Phase 3: Organize What's Left

- [ ] Label if necessary

3. **DECISION FATIGUE HELP**

- Sentimental items: [One box rule]

4. **ADHD-FRIENDLY APPROACH**

9. **KEEPING IT REAL**

This WON'T be:

- Done in one day

This WILL be:

10. **FAMILY/ROOMMATE CHALLENGES**
