                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me create a 90-day plan to improve my credit score significantly without paying for expensive credit repair services.

MY CURRENT CREDIT SITUATION:
- Current credit score (if known): [SCORE] from [CREDIT KARMA / CREDIT CARD / etc.]
- Last time I checked all 3 bureau reports: [NEVER / 6 MONTHS AGO / RECENTLY]
- Major negative items: [LATE PAYMENTS / COLLECTIONS / CHARGE-OFFS / BANKRUPTCY / FORECLOSURE]
- Current credit card balances: $[TOTAL] across [NUMBER] cards
- Total available credit: $[AMOUNT]
- Monthly income: $[AMOUNT]
- Biggest credit mistakes: [MISSED PAYMENTS / MAXED OUT CARDS / TOO MANY APPLICATIONS]
- Credit goal: [GET APPROVED FOR CAR LOAN / MORTGAGE / LOWER INTEREST RATES / GENERAL IMPROVEMENT]
- Timeline pressure: [NEED RESULTS IN 90 DAYS / CAN WAIT LONGER IF NECESSARY]

CREATE MY 90-DAY CREDIT REPAIR PLAN:

1. **WEEK 1-2: ASSESSMENT AND DISPUTE PREPARATION**
Get the complete picture and start fixing errors:
- How to get all 3 free credit reports (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
- Line-by-line review process to identify errors and disputes
- Common errors that are easiest to get removed quickly
- Documentation to gather for successful disputes
- Priority order - which items to dispute first for maximum impact

2. **WEEK 3-4: DISPUTE LETTERS THAT WORK**
File disputes that actually get results:
- Template dispute letters for different types of errors
- Online vs. mail disputes - which works better when
- How to word disputes to avoid automatic rejection
- Documentation to include with each dispute
- Tracking system to follow up on disputes properly

3. **WEEK 5-8: BALANCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY**
Manipulate credit utilization for score boosts:
- Ideal credit utilization ratios (per card and overall)
- Strategic payment timing to optimize statement balances
- Which cards to pay down first for maximum score impact
- How to request credit limit increases without hurting score
- Balance transfer strategies if applicable to my situation

4. **WEEK 9-12: PAYMENT HISTORY OPTIMIZATION**
Lock in perfect payment patterns:
- Automated payment setup to never miss a payment again
- How to handle past due accounts without further damage
- Negotiating payment plans that don't hurt credit more
- "Pay for delete" letter templates that actually work
- Building positive payment history on all accounts

5. **AUTHORIZED USER STRATEGY**
Piggyback on someone else's good credit:
- How to find family/friends with excellent credit willing to help
- Which accounts make the best authorized user additions
- Timeline for when authorized user accounts show up and impact score
- Risks and how to protect both parties
- Exit strategy when I no longer need the boost

6. **COLLECTIONS AND CHARGE-OFF NEGOTIATIONS**
Deal with the worst credit killers:
- How to verify if collections are valid or errors
- Settlement negotiation strategies that don't hurt score further
- "Pay for delete" vs. "paid in full" - what actually helps credit
- Statute of limitations and when to let sleeping dogs lie
- Written agreements to get before paying anything

7. **RAPID SCORE BOOSTING TACTICS**
Advanced strategies for faster results:
- Credit card cycling to manipulate utilization reporting
- Multiple payment strategy for maxed-out cards
- Goodwill letters for past mistakes with good customers
- Rapid rescoring techniques for mortgage applications
- When to use credit monitoring vs. when it's a waste

8. **LONG-TERM CREDIT BUILDING**
Set up systems for continued improvement:
- New credit applications - when and how to apply strategically
- Credit mix optimization (cards, loans, etc.)
- Age of accounts - what to keep open and what to close
- Monitoring system to catch new problems early
- 6-month and 1-year plans for continued improvement

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No credit repair company recommendations - I want to do this myself
- All strategies must be legal and ethical (no illegal "credit washing")
- Focus on realistic improvements - I can't fix everything in 90 days
- Include specific timelines for when to expect results
- Address my specific negative items and situation
- Give alternatives if certain strategies don't apply to me
- Include exact scripts for phone calls and letter templates

I need better credit fast but I don't want to pay hundreds to credit repair companies. Give me a step-by-step plan I can execute myself to see real improvement in 90 days.</textarea>
