                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me cut my grocery bills in half without sacrificing nutrition or eating the same boring meals every week.

MY GROCERY SITUATION:
- Current monthly grocery spending: $[AMOUNT]
- Number of people I'm feeding: [NUMBER]
- Ages of family members: [ADULTS / KIDS / TEENAGERS]
- Dietary restrictions: [ALLERGIES / VEGETARIAN / LOW-CARB / DIABETIC / NONE]
- Foods we absolutely won't eat: [LIST DISLIKES]
- Kitchen equipment: [BASIC / FULL KITCHEN / SLOW COOKER / INSTANT POT / FREEZER SPACE]
- Time available for meal prep: [NONE / 1 HOUR / 2+ HOURS per week]
- Biggest grocery challenges: [TOO EXPENSIVE / FOOD GOES BAD / PICKY EATERS / NO TIME TO COOK]

CREATE MY GROCERY SAVINGS PLAN:

1. **SMART SHOPPING STRATEGY**
Spend less at the store without couponing:
- Best days and times to shop for maximum savings
- Store layout strategy (which sections to hit first and last)
- How to avoid impulse purchases that kill budgets
- Seasonal buying calendar for lowest prices
- Generic vs. brand name - when it matters and when it doesn't

2. **THE $50 WEEKLY CHALLENGE**
Feed my family well on $50/week or less:
- Sample weekly meal plans that hit this target
- Core staple ingredients that stretch furthest
- How to build meals around what's on sale
- Protein strategies that don't break the bank
- Vegetable and fruit buying guide for maximum nutrition per dollar

3. **BULK BUYING WITHOUT WASTE**
Buy in bulk without throwing money away:
- Which items are worth buying in bulk for my family size
- Storage solutions that don't require a warehouse
- How to split bulk purchases with friends/neighbors
- Rotation system to prevent food spoilage
- When bulk buying actually costs MORE (avoid these!)

4. **MEAL PLANNING THAT SAVES MONEY**
Plan once, save all month:
- Simple meal planning system that prevents food waste
- How to plan around sales and seasonal ingredients
- Leftover transformation strategies (turn Sunday's chicken into 3 meals)
- Batch cooking techniques for busy schedules
- Emergency meal backup plans using pantry staples

5. **STORE AND APP HACKS**
Maximize savings without extreme couponing:
- Best money-saving apps that actually work
- Store loyalty programs worth joining (and which to skip)
- Price matching policies - how to use them effectively
- Best times to find clearance items and manager's specials
- Online grocery deals vs. in-store shopping comparison

6. **PROTEIN ON A BUDGET**
Get enough protein without going broke:
- Cheapest protein sources per gram (includes plant-based)
- How to buy and prepare cheaper cuts of meat
- Egg-based meals that don't feel like you're eating eggs again
- Bean and legume strategies for people who "don't like beans"
- When frozen/canned proteins beat fresh

7. **KITCHEN EFFICIENCY FOR SAVINGS**
Make your kitchen work harder for your money:
- Food storage techniques that double shelf life
- Freezer strategies for bulk cooking and sale shopping
- How to properly store produce to prevent waste
- Kitchen tools that actually save money (not gadgets)
- Repurpose and transform techniques for leftovers

8. **AVOID THE BUDGET KILLERS**
Common mistakes that ruin grocery budgets:
- Hidden expenses that add up (shopping bags, impulse items)
- "Healthy" foods that aren't worth the premium price
- Convenience items that cost 300% more than homemade
- Shopping mistakes that happen when you're tired or hungry
- How to handle special occasions without blowing the budget

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No extreme measures like dumpster diving or eating only rice and beans
- Must include variety - I want to enjoy eating, not just survive
- Focus on real food, not just cheap processed stuff
- Include strategies for picky eaters and dietary restrictions
- Make it sustainable for busy people who work full-time
- Address my specific family size and eating preferences
- Give practical alternatives if one strategy doesn't work

I'm tired of choosing between eating well and having money left over. Help me create a realistic system that cuts my grocery bills in half while still feeding my family nutritious, tasty meals.</textarea>
