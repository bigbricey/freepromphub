                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me systematically go through my house and turn items I don't need into $1000+ cash using the most profitable selling strategies.

MY SELLING SITUATION:
- Living situation: [HOUSE / APARTMENT / SHARED SPACE] 
- How much clutter: [ROOM FULL / CLOSETS STUFFED / GARAGE PACKED / SCATTERED THROUGHOUT]
- Types of items I probably have: [ELECTRONICS / CLOTHES / FURNITURE / BOOKS / COLLECTIBLES / TOOLS / KITCHEN STUFF]
- Time available for selling: [WEEKENDS ONLY / EVENINGS / FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE]
- Transportation: [RELIABLE CAR / NO CAR / LIMITED MOBILITY]
- Selling experience: [NEVER SOLD ONLINE / SOME EXPERIENCE / PRETTY COMFORTABLE]
- Goal timeline: [NEED CASH IN 30 DAYS / CAN TAKE 3 MONTHS / NO RUSH]

CREATE MY HOUSE-TO-CASH PLAN:

1. **THE $1000 TREASURE HUNT**
Systematically identify valuable items:
- Room-by-room checklist of items that actually sell for good money
- Hidden value items people overlook (what's in your junk drawer worth $50+)
- Quick research methods to check if something is valuable
- Items to definitely keep vs. items that are just taking up space
- How to spot collectibles, vintage items, or accidentally valuable things

2. **HIGH-VALUE ITEM IDENTIFICATION**
Focus on items worth $50+ each:
- Electronics that hold value vs. those that don't
- Furniture pieces that sell quickly for good money
- Clothing and accessories with resale value
- Tools and equipment that professionals will buy
- Books, media, and collectibles worth checking

3. **PLATFORM STRATEGY**
Choose the right selling platform for each item:
- Facebook Marketplace vs. eBay vs. Craigslist - which for what
- Specialized platforms for specific items (Poshmark, Mercari, etc.)
- Local vs. shipping - when each makes more sense
- Bulk selling vs. individual items for maximum profit
- Platforms to avoid that waste your time

4. **PRICING FOR PROFIT**
Get maximum value without scaring away buyers:
- Research methods to price items competitively but profitably
- When to start high and negotiate vs. price to sell fast
- Seasonal timing - what sells better when
- Bundle strategies to increase average sale value
- How to handle lowball offers and negotiate effectively

5. **PHOTOS AND LISTINGS THAT SELL**
Create listings that get results:
- Photo techniques using just your phone that make items look valuable
- Listing descriptions that highlight value and create urgency
- Keywords that help people find your items
- Common listing mistakes that kill sales
- Templates for different types of items

6. **SAFETY AND LOGISTICS**
Handle transactions safely and efficiently:
- Meeting buyers safely for local sales
- Packaging and shipping for online sales without losing money
- Payment methods that protect you from scams
- How to handle returns, complaints, and difficult buyers
- Time management to handle multiple sales efficiently

7. **VOLUME SELLING STRATEGIES**
Move lots of items quickly:
- Garage sale organization for maximum profit
- Lot selling strategies for similar items
- How to price items to move while still making good money
- Bulk buyers who will take large quantities
- End-of-selling-period strategies (donate vs. trash vs. store)

8. **TAX AND RECORD KEEPING**
Handle the business side properly:
- What sales income you need to report to IRS
- Simple record keeping for tax purposes
- Receipts and documentation to keep
- When selling household items becomes a business
- How to maximize deductions if this becomes ongoing

ITEM-SPECIFIC SELLING GUIDES:

**ELECTRONICS:** 
- Which old phones, tablets, laptops still have value
- Gaming systems and games that hold value vs. worthless ones
- How to wipe personal data safely before selling

**CLOTHING & ACCESSORIES:**
- Designer items worth researching carefully
- Seasonal timing for clothing sales
- Shoes and accessories that hold value

**FURNITURE & HOUSEHOLD:**
- Items that sell quickly vs. items that sit forever
- How to stage furniture for photos
- Delivery and pickup logistics

**BOOKS & MEDIA:**
- Textbooks and specialty books worth checking
- Vinyl records, DVDs, CDs that still have value
- Bulk selling strategies for large collections

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Focus on items worth $20+ (don't waste time on $5 items)
- Start with easiest/highest value items first
- Include realistic time estimates for each selling method
- Address my specific living situation and transportation
- Give backup plans if certain platforms don't work in my area
- Include safety precautions for meeting strangers
- Make it efficient - I don't want this to become a part-time job
