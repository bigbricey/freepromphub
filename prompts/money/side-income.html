                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me create a realistic plan to earn an extra $500 in the next 30 days using my current skills, schedule, and resources.

MY SITUATION:
- Main job: [FULL-TIME / PART-TIME / UNEMPLOYED / STUDENT]
- Available time per week: [EVENINGS ONLY / WEEKENDS / 5-10 HOURS / 10-20 HOURS]
- Current skills: [WRITING / DRIVING / TEACHING / TECH / CRAFTS / NONE SPECIAL]
- Transportation: [RELIABLE CAR / NO CAR / PUBLIC TRANSPORT ONLY]
- Starting capital: $[AMOUNT] available to invest
- Physical limitations: [NONE / CAN'T LIFT HEAVY / PREFER SITTING / HEALTH ISSUES]
- Location: [BIG CITY / SUBURBS / SMALL TOWN / RURAL]
- Comfort with online work: [VERY COMFORTABLE / SOME EXPERIENCE / COMPLETE BEGINNER]

WHAT I'VE ALREADY TRIED:
- Previous side hustles: [UBER / FREELANCE / SURVEYS / NOTHING YET]
- What worked and what didn't: [EXPLAIN]
- Biggest obstacles: [NO TIME / NO SKILLS / NO CONFIDENCE / DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START]

CREATE MY $500 PLAN:

1. **QUICK CASH (Week 1) - $100-150 Target**
Start earning within 7 days:
- Immediate income opportunities using what I already have
- Items I can sell from my house (without sacrificing things I need)
- One-time services I can offer to friends, family, neighbors
- Gig work that pays the fastest (same day or next day)
- Skills I can monetize immediately with no preparation

2. **SERVICE-BASED INCOME (Week 2-3) - $200-250 Target**
Build on quick wins with ongoing services:
- Local services I can offer based on my skills and schedule
- Digital services that don't require technical expertise
- Recurring work opportunities (weekly/bi-weekly clients)
- How to price my services competitively but profitably
- Simple marketing to get my first 3-5 customers

3. **ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES (Week 2-4) - $150-200 Target**
Remote work that fits my schedule:
- Beginner-friendly freelance work I can do from home
- Online platforms that actually pay decent money (not surveys)
- Skills I can learn quickly that are in demand
- How to create compelling profiles that get me hired
- Time management to balance online work with my main job

4. **OPTIMIZE EXISTING RESOURCES**
Turn what I have into money:
- Unused subscriptions, memberships, or services I can sell/sublet
- Space in my home I can rent out (parking, storage, etc.)
- Equipment or tools I can rent to others
- Skills from my day job that people will pay for privately
- Network opportunities (friends/colleagues who might hire me)

5. **AVOID THE TIME WASTERS**
Don't fall for these money traps:
- "Opportunities" that require upfront payments or inventory
- Get-rich-quick schemes that promise easy money
- Survey sites and apps that pay pennies per hour
- MLM and pyramid schemes disguised as "business opportunities"
- Anything that requires me to recruit other people

6. **SCALING STRATEGY**
Turn $500 into ongoing income:
- Which opportunities have potential for recurring revenue
- How to ask for referrals from satisfied customers
- Simple systems to manage multiple income streams
- When to raise prices and how much
- Transitioning from one-time gigs to regular clients

7. **TIME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
Fit side income around my real life:
- Daily/weekly schedule that doesn't burn me out
- How to be productive during limited available hours
- Batch working strategies for maximum efficiency
- Setting boundaries so side work doesn't hurt my main job
- Energy management - when to work on different types of tasks

8. **REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS**
Keep it achievable and sustainable:
- Week-by-week income targets that add up to $500+
- Backup plans if my first choice doesn't work out
- How to track progress and adjust strategy if needed
- What to do after the first $500 (continue or try something else)
- Signs it's working vs. signs I need to pivot

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No schemes, scams, or anything that sounds too good to be true
- Must work within my actual available time (don't suggest 40-hour commitments)
- Focus on legitimate work that pays fair wages
- Include both online and local opportunities
- Give me alternatives if one approach doesn't fit my situation
- Make it actionable - I need to know exactly what to do first
- Address my specific skills, location, and limitations

I need real money for real expenses. Give me a step-by-step plan that actually works for someone with limited time who needs to earn $500 in the next 30 days.</textarea>
