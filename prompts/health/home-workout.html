                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Create a realistic home fitness plan that I can actually stick with using no equipment.

MY FITNESS SITUATION:
- Current fitness level: [COMPLETE BEGINNER / OUT OF SHAPE / SOMEWHAT ACTIVE / PRETTY FIT]
- Age: [YOUR AGE]
- Any injuries or limitations: [BAD KNEES / BACK PROBLEMS / etc., or NONE]
- Time available for workouts: [15 MINUTES / 30 MINUTES / 45 MINUTES]
- How many days per week I can realistically exercise: [3 DAYS / 4 DAYS / 5+ DAYS]
- Space available: [SMALL APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM / BEDROOM ONLY / YARD ACCESS]
- Fitness goals: [LOSE WEIGHT / GET STRONGER / MORE ENERGY / LOOK BETTER / GENERAL HEALTH]
- What I hate about exercise: [BEING SWEATY / FEELING JUDGED / COMPLICATED ROUTINES / etc.]

CREATE MY HOME FITNESS PLAN:

1. **PERFECT BEGINNER WORKOUT** (Week 1-2)
Start super simple so I don't quit:
- 15-minute routine I can do every other day
- Exercises using only my body weight
- Modifications for complete beginners
- How to know if I'm doing it right
- What muscle soreness is normal vs. concerning

2. **EQUIPMENT-FREE EXERCISES**
Effective moves I can do anywhere:
- Upper body strengthening (no weights needed)
- Lower body building (squats, lunges variations)
- Core work that actually works
- Simple cardio that doesn't feel like torture
- Stretches to prevent soreness and injury

3. **PROGRESSIVE WORKOUT PLAN**
How to level up as I get stronger:
- Week 1-2: Foundation building
- Week 3-4: Adding intensity
- Week 5-8: Building strength and endurance
- How to know when to increase difficulty
- What to do when exercises become too easy

4. **REALISTIC WEEKLY SCHEDULE**
Fit workouts into real life:
- Which days to work out (based on my schedule)
- Morning vs. evening workout pros/cons for my situation
- How to stay consistent when life gets crazy
- Quick 10-minute options for busy days
- Weekend workout strategies

5. **HOUSEHOLD ITEM WORKOUTS**
Use what I already have:
- Water bottles or milk jugs as weights
- Stairs for cardio and strength
- Chair/couch exercises
- Wall workouts
- Towel resistance exercises

6. **SMALL SPACE SOLUTIONS**
Make it work anywhere:
- Exercises for tiny apartments
- Quiet workouts (won't disturb neighbors)
- Bedroom-only routines
- No jumping/high-impact alternatives
- Quick clean-up between exercises

7. **MOTIVATION & CONSISTENCY**
How to stick with it long-term:
- Track progress without obsessing over numbers
- Reward system that isn't food-based
- What to do when I don't want to exercise
- How to restart after missing several days
- Signs that it's working (besides just weight loss)

8. **COMMON BEGINNER PROBLEMS**
Solutions for typical issues:
- Too sore to continue - recovery strategies
- Not seeing results fast enough - realistic expectations
- Bored with routine - how to add variety
- Family/roommate interruptions - workout boundary setting
- Weather affecting motivation - indoor backup plans

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No gym membership or expensive equipment required
- Exercises must be safe for beginners
- Nothing that requires perfect form to avoid injury
- Must work in normal living spaces
- Include modifications for people with physical limitations
- Keep it simple enough to remember without constantly checking instructions
- Focus on building the exercise habit first, intensity second
