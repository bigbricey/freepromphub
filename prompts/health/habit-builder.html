                    Tired of starting healthy habits that fizzle out in a week? This prompt uses proven psychology to help you build lasting changes. Perfect for people who've tried and failed at habit building before.

                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly">Help me build healthy habits that actually stick long-term, based on science and psychology, not just willpower.

MY HABIT-BUILDING SITUATION:
- Habit I want to build: [BE SPECIFIC - e.g., "Exercise 30 min daily" not just "get fit"]
- Why this matters to me: [PERSONAL MOTIVATION - health, family, confidence, etc.]
- Previous attempts: [WHAT I'VE TRIED BEFORE AND WHY IT FAILED]
- Current routine: [DESCRIBE MY TYPICAL DAY/SCHEDULE]
- Biggest obstacles: [LACK OF TIME / MOTIVATION / ENERGY / CONSISTENCY / FORGETFULNESS]
- Success timeline: [WANT RESULTS IN 30 DAYS / 3 MONTHS / 1 YEAR]
- Life situation: [BUSY PARENT / STUDENT / WORKER / RETIREE / etc.]
- Personality: [PERFECTIONIST / PROCRASTINATOR / ALL-OR-NOTHING / GRADUAL CHANGER]

CREATE MY HABIT-BUILDING PLAN:

1. **HABIT FOUNDATION SETUP**
Make success inevitable, not dependent on willpower:
- Start ridiculously small (so small I can't say no)
- Best time of day for this habit based on my schedule
- Environmental design to make the habit easier
- Trigger that will remind me to do the habit
- How to attach this to an existing routine (habit stacking)

2. **PSYCHOLOGICAL SUCCESS STRATEGIES**
Work with my brain, not against it:
- How to overcome the initial resistance
- Identity-based approach (who I need to become)
- Reward system that reinforces the habit
- How to handle perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking
- Mental reframes when I don't feel like doing it

3. **WEEK-BY-WEEK PROGRESSION PLAN**
Scale up gradually without overwhelming myself:
- Week 1-2: Minimum viable habit (build the routine first)
- Week 3-4: Slight increase (still manageable)
- Month 2: Adding complexity or duration
- Month 3+: Full habit implementation
- How to know when I'm ready to level up

4. **OBSTACLE PREVENTION & SOLUTIONS**
Plan for real-life challenges:
- What to do when I'm sick, traveling, or stressed
- How to restart after missing days (without guilt spirals)
- Adapting the habit for busy/chaotic days
- Dealing with family/friends who don't support the change
- Emergency backup plans for my biggest obstacles

5. **TRACKING & MOTIVATION SYSTEM**
Stay motivated without becoming obsessive:
- Simple tracking method that works for me
- Milestones to celebrate along the way
- How to measure progress (not just completion)
- When to reward myself and with what
- Warning signs that I'm losing momentum

6. **MAKING IT AUTOMATIC**
Move from conscious effort to unconscious routine:
- Signs that my habit is becoming automatic
- How to strengthen the habit loop over time
- Building habit consistency across different situations
- Creating backup triggers for when life changes
- Long-term maintenance strategies

7. **COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID**
Learn from others' mistakes:
- Starting too big (and how to scale back)
- Perfectionism traps that derail progress
- Motivation vs. discipline balance
- Social pressure and comparison issues
- How to avoid the "what the hell" effect

8. **HABIT STACKING & INTEGRATION**
Build multiple healthy habits systematically:
- Which habit to focus on first (if I want multiple changes)
- How to add a second habit without destroying the first
- Creating morning and evening routine chains
- Connecting habits to existing strong routines
- Building a lifestyle around my new identity

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Base everything on behavioral science, not just motivation
- Start smaller than I think I need to
- Focus on consistency over intensity initially
- Include specific plans for when I mess up (not if)
- Make it work with my real life, not my ideal life
- Address my specific personality and obstacles
- Give me alternatives if my first approach doesn't work

I'm tired of failing at building good habits. Help me create a system that works for someone who's struggled with consistency before, using proven psychology rather than just hoping willpower will be enough this time.</textarea>
