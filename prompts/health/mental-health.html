                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me create a simple daily mental health check-in system to track my mood, identify patterns, and improve my emotional well-being.

MY MENTAL HEALTH SITUATION:
- Current mental health challenges: [ANXIETY / DEPRESSION / STRESS / MOOD SWINGS / FEELING OVERWHELMED / NONE SPECIFIC]
- What affects my mood most: [WORK STRESS / RELATIONSHIPS / MONEY / HEALTH / SLEEP / SEASONAL CHANGES]
- Time of day when I feel worst: [MORNINGS / AFTERNOONS / EVENINGS / VARIES]
- How I currently handle bad days: [ISOLATE / TALK TO SOMEONE / EXERCISE / NOTHING SPECIFIC]
- Support system: [STRONG / MODERATE / LIMITED / NONE]
- Professional help: [SEEING THERAPIST / CONSIDERING IT / NOT INTERESTED / NOT NEEDED]
- Time available for self-care: [5 MINUTES / 15 MINUTES / 30+ MINUTES daily]

CREATE MY MENTAL HEALTH CHECK-IN SYSTEM:

1. **DAILY MOOD CHECK-IN** (2-3 minutes)
Simple questions to ask myself each day:
- Quick mood scale rating system
- Energy level assessment
- Stress/anxiety level check
- Sleep quality impact on mood
- One thing I'm grateful for today

2. **WEEKLY PATTERN TRACKING**
Identify what affects my mental health:
- Mood trends over the week
- Triggers that consistently affect me negatively
- Activities/people that consistently boost my mood
- Physical factors (exercise, food, sleep) and mood connections
- Stress patterns and recovery times

3. **EMOTIONAL REGULATION TOOLKIT**
Quick strategies for different mood states:
- When I'm anxious: 3 immediate calming techniques
- When I'm sad/down: Gentle mood lifts that work for me
- When I'm angry/frustrated: Healthy ways to release energy
- When I'm overwhelmed: Simplification and grounding strategies
- When I'm numb/disconnected: Ways to re-engage with life

4. **DAILY MENTAL WELLNESS PRACTICES**
Small actions that support good mental health:
- 5-minute morning mental health routine
- Midday mood check and adjustment
- Evening reflection and reset
- Simple mindfulness moments throughout the day
- Boundary setting to protect my mental energy

5. **WARNING SIGN RECOGNITION**
Know when I need extra support:
- Red flag symptoms that mean I need help
- Early warning signs before things get bad
- When to reach out to friends/family
- When to consider professional help
- Crisis resources and emergency contacts

6. **SELF-CARE PRESCRIPTION**
Personalized activities that improve my mental health:
- Quick mood boosters (5-10 minutes)
- Longer self-care practices (30+ minutes)
- Social activities vs. alone time balance
- Creative/hobby activities that help me
- Physical activities that improve my mental state

7. **RELATIONSHIP & SOCIAL WELLNESS**
How connections affect my mental health:
- People who boost vs. drain my mental energy
- How to communicate my needs to others
- Setting healthy boundaries with toxic relationships
- Building supportive connections
- When to seek social interaction vs. solitude

8. **LONG-TERM MENTAL HEALTH BUILDING**
Strengthen resilience over time:
- Monthly mental health goal setting
- Building emotional intelligence skills
- Stress management techniques that work for me
- How to maintain mental health during difficult periods
- Creating a mental health emergency plan

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Keep daily check-ins simple and quick (not overwhelming)
- Focus on awareness and small improvements, not perfection
- Include practical tools I can use when feeling bad
- Address my specific mental health challenges
- Don't replace professional help if I need it
- Make it sustainable for busy, stressful life
- Give me options for different energy levels and time availability

I want to be more aware of my mental health patterns and have practical tools to feel better on difficult days. Help me create a system that fits into my real life and actually helps me build emotional resilience.</textarea>
