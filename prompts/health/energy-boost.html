                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me boost my energy naturally without relying on caffeine, energy drinks, or expensive supplements.

MY ENERGY SITUATION:
- Current energy pattern: [TIRED ALL DAY / MORNING CRASH / AFTERNOON SLUMP / EVENING EXHAUSTION]
- Sleep quality: [GREAT / GOOD / POOR / TERRIBLE - HOW MANY HOURS?]
- Caffeine intake: [NONE / 1-2 CUPS COFFEE / MULTIPLE COFFEES / ENERGY DRINKS]
- When I feel most tired: [MORNING / AFTER LUNCH / 2-4 PM / EVENING / ALL THE TIME]
- Diet habits: [SKIP MEALS / EAT REGULARLY / LOTS OF SUGAR / PRETTY HEALTHY]
- Activity level: [SEDENTARY / LIGHTLY ACTIVE / MODERATELY ACTIVE]
- Stress level: [LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / OVERWHELMING]
- Medical issues: [NONE / THYROID / ANEMIA / DIABETES / OTHER]

CREATE MY NATURAL ENERGY PLAN:

1. **IMMEDIATE ENERGY BOOSTERS** (Works in 5-15 minutes)
Quick fixes when I'm dragging:
- Breathing techniques that energize instantly
- Simple movements to wake up my body
- Hydration strategies (it's not just water!)
- Light exposure tricks for alertness
- Quick snacks that boost energy without crashes

2. **DAILY ENERGY FOUNDATION**
Build consistent energy all day:
- Morning routine that sets me up for sustained energy
- Meal timing and combinations for steady blood sugar
- Water intake strategy (how much, when, what kind)
- Light exposure patterns that regulate natural energy
- Simple movement breaks that recharge me

3. **FOOD FOR SUSTAINED ENERGY**
Eat for energy, not crashes:
- Best breakfast combinations for lasting energy
- Lunch choices that prevent afternoon crashes
- Smart snacking for energy maintenance
- Foods that steal my energy (what to limit)
- Meal prep ideas for consistent energy nutrition

4. **NATURAL ENERGY RHYTHMS**
Work with my body, not against it:
- Identify my natural high and low energy times
- How to schedule tasks based on energy patterns
- Power nap strategies (when, how long, best practices)
- Evening routine that sets up tomorrow's energy
- Weekend recovery that doesn't ruin weekdays

5. **MOVEMENT FOR ENERGY**
Exercise that energizes instead of exhausting:
- 5-minute energizing movements I can do anywhere
- Desk exercises for office energy slumps
- Walking strategies that boost alertness
- Stretches that combat fatigue
- How much movement I need (without overdoing it)

6. **ENERGY ENVIRONMENT**
Optimize my surroundings:
- Lighting changes that boost natural alertness
- Air quality improvements for better energy
- Decluttering for mental energy
- Temperature adjustments that keep me alert
- How to create energizing spaces at home and work

7. **STRESS & ENERGY CONNECTION**
Manage energy drains:
- How stress steals my energy (and what to do about it)
- Boundary setting to preserve energy
- Mental habits that drain vs. boost energy
- How to recover energy after stressful situations
- Signs that stress is affecting my energy levels

8. **TROUBLESHOOTING LOW ENERGY**
When nothing seems to work:
- Red flags that mean I should see a doctor
- How to track energy patterns to identify problems
- Gradual changes vs. dramatic overhauls
- What to do when I'm too tired to implement changes
- Building energy reserves for demanding periods

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No expensive supplements or gadgets required
- Solutions must work for busy people with real lives
- Focus on sustainable changes, not quick fixes that backfire
- Include options for people who can't exercise much
- Address the root causes, not just symptoms
- Give me alternatives if one approach doesn't work
- Keep it simple enough to stick with long-term

I'm tired of feeling tired all the time. I want natural, sustainable energy that doesn't depend on caffeine or crash later. Help me feel naturally energized throughout the day.</textarea>
