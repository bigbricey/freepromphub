Perfect for first-time meal preppers:
- 3 easy recipes I can make in bulk
- Basic ingredients I can find anywhere
- Step-by-step prep order (most efficient)

- What containers I actually need (budget-friendly options)

2. **SMART GROCERY SHOPPING**
Shop once, eat all week:

- What to buy fresh vs. frozen vs. canned
- How to shop efficiently (store layout strategy)
- Total estimated cost breakdown

3. **FOOLPROOF PREP PROCESS**

- How to prep when you're tired or unmotivated
- Clean-as-you-go system

4. **STORAGE & REHEATING MASTERY**
Make it taste good all week:
- Best containers for each type of food
- How long each meal stays fresh
- Reheating instructions that don't make food soggy
- Freezer-friendly options for busy weeks
- Food safety basics (when to throw it out)

5. **VARIETY WITHOUT COMPLEXITY**
Avoid meal prep boredom:
- How to make the same base ingredients taste different
- Simple sauce recipes that transform meals

Learn from others' failures:
- Foods that don't reheat well (skip these!)
- Portion sizes that actually satisfy you
- Why your meals might taste bland (and how to fix it)
- Storage mistakes that waste food
- Over-prepping vs. under-prepping balance

8. **GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN**

- Week 3-4: Add variety and improve efficiency
- Month 2: Experiment with new recipes and techniques
- How to know when you're ready to level up
- Signs your meal prep system is working

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No expensive specialty ingredients or equipment

- Must save both time and money compared to buying food
- Include prep-ahead options for crazy busy weeks
- Keep it simple enough to stick with long-term

I want to eat healthier and save money, but I'm new to meal prep and don't want to spend my entire weekend cooking. Make this sustainable and foolproof.</textarea>
