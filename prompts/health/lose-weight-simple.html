                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Create a simple, realistic plan to lose 10 pounds without feeling like I'm "on a diet."

MY SITUATION:
- Current weight: [YOUR CURRENT WEIGHT] 
- Goal: Lose 10 pounds in [TIMEFRAME - be realistic, 8-12 weeks is good]
- Age: [YOUR AGE]
- Activity level: [SEDENTARY/LIGHTLY ACTIVE/MODERATELY ACTIVE]
- Time available daily: [15 MINUTES / 30 MINUTES / 1 HOUR]
- Foods I hate: [LIST FOODS YOU WON'T EAT]
- Foods I love: [LIST FAVORITES - we'll keep some of these!]
- Biggest eating challenges: [STRESS EATING / LATE NIGHT SNACKING / SKIP MEALS / EAT TOO FAST / etc.]
- Exercise limitations: [BAD KNEES / NO GYM / HATE RUNNING / etc.]

CREATE THIS PLAN FOR ME:

1. **SIMPLE FOOD SWAPS** 
Instead of cutting foods out, give me easy swaps:
- What to replace my usual breakfast with
- Better lunch options that I can grab quickly
- Dinner improvements that my family will eat too
- Snack upgrades that satisfy cravings
- Keep it realistic - no weird ingredients or complicated prep

2. **EASY MOVEMENT PLAN**
Based on my time and limitations:
- Something I can do at home with no equipment
- Start small and build up slowly
- Activities that don't feel like punishment
- How to fit movement into my existing routine
- Options for days when I'm exhausted

3. **HABIT CHANGES** 
Small tweaks to my daily routine:
- Better eating timing
- Portion control without measuring everything
- Ways to avoid my biggest food triggers
- Simple sleep improvements (affects weight!)
- Stress management that doesn't take extra time

4. **REALISTIC WEEKLY PLAN**
Week-by-week approach:
- Week 1-2: What to focus on first (don't change everything at once!)
- Week 3-4: What to add next
- Week 5-8: Building consistency
- Week 9-12: Fine-tuning what works

5. **PRACTICAL TIPS**
Real-world solutions:
- What to do when I mess up (because I will)
- How to handle social eating, restaurants, holidays
- Quick fixes for bad days
- Ways to stay motivated without obsessing over the scale
- How to know if it's working (besides just weight)

6. **GROCERY SHOPPING GUIDE**
Make it simple:
- 20 foods to always have on hand
- Easy meal combinations using these foods
- How to prep for the week in 30 minutes
- Budget-friendly options
- What to avoid buying (triggers)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- No calorie counting required
- No cutting out entire food groups
- Nothing that requires special equipment or gym membership
- Nothing that takes more than 30 minutes to prepare
- Must work with a busy, stressful lifestyle
- Focus on adding good things, not just removing bad things
- Make it feel sustainable, not like deprivation

I want to lose weight without feeling like I'm constantly fighting myself. Make this feel natural and doable for someone who's tried and failed at diets before.</textarea>
