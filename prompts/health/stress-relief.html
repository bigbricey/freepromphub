                    <textarea id="prompt-text" class="prompt-textarea" readonly>Help me create quick stress relief techniques I can use when I'm feeling overwhelmed and need to calm down fast.

MY STRESS SITUATION:
- Main stress triggers: [WORK DEADLINES / MONEY WORRIES / FAMILY DRAMA / HEALTH CONCERNS / TRAFFIC / etc.]
- When I get most stressed: [MORNINGS / AFTERNOONS / EVENINGS / WEEKENDS]
- Physical stress symptoms: [TIGHT SHOULDERS / HEADACHES / SHALLOW BREATHING / RACING HEART / STOMACH KNOTS]
- Current location when stressed: [OFFICE / CAR / HOME / PUBLIC PLACES]
- Time available for relief: [2 MINUTES / 5 MINUTES / 10 MINUTES MAX]
- What I've tried: [DEEP BREATHING / MEDITATION APPS / EXERCISE / NOTHING YET]
- Privacy level needed: [CAN BE OBVIOUS / NEED TO BE DISCRETE / HOME ONLY]

CREATE MY STRESS RELIEF TOOLKIT:

1. **INSTANT RELIEF (30 seconds - 2 minutes)**
For when stress hits hard and fast:
- Emergency breathing technique I can do anywhere
- Quick body reset (release physical tension)
- Mental circuit breaker to stop racing thoughts
- Discrete techniques for public spaces
- How to use these without anyone noticing

2. **5-MINUTE CALM DOWN**
When I have a few minutes to reset:
- Progressive relaxation (simplified version)
- Grounding technique using my 5 senses
- Quick meditation that actually works for beginners
- Stress-busting movement I can do in small spaces
- Mental reframe questions to change my perspective

3. **WORKPLACE STRESS BUSTERS**
Office-friendly stress relief:
- Techniques I can do at my desk
- Bathroom break stress relief (private space)
- How to handle difficult conversations/meetings
- Computer break stress reset
- Ways to prevent stress buildup during the workday

4. **STRESS PREVENTION STRATEGIES**
Stop stress before it starts:
- Morning routine to build stress resistance
- How to recognize my early stress warning signs
- Quick check-ins throughout the day
- Boundaries that reduce daily stress
- Simple lifestyle tweaks that lower baseline stress

5. **EMERGENCY STRESS SITUATIONS**
For the really bad days:
- When I can't stop crying or shaking
- Panic attack management (if I get them)
- How to handle overwhelming situations
- When to ask for help vs. handle it myself
- Recovery plan after a stress meltdown

6. **LOCATION-SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES**
Stress relief anywhere:
- In the car (traffic, commuting)
- At home with family around
- Public places (stores, waiting rooms)
- During phone calls or video meetings
- Late at night when stress keeps me awake

7. **STRESS RELIEF WITHOUT APPS**
No technology needed:
- Techniques that don't require phones or apps
- Using everyday items for stress relief
- Mental techniques I can memorize
- Physical movements that calm me down
- Simple mantras or phrases that work

8. **LONG-TERM STRESS MANAGEMENT**
Building resilience over time:
- Daily habits that reduce overall stress levels
- How to build stress tolerance gradually
- Warning signs that I need professional help
- Creating a support system for tough times
- How to bounce back from stressful periods

IMPORTANT RULES:
- All techniques must work in under 10 minutes
- Nothing that requires special equipment or apps
- Must be effective in real-world stressful situations
- Include options for different privacy levels
- Focus on techniques I can actually remember when stressed
- Give me alternatives if something doesn't work for me
- Keep it practical, not "woo-woo" or overly spiritual

I need real solutions for real stress that I can use when life feels overwhelming. Make this practical for someone who doesn't have time for hour-long meditation sessions.</textarea>
