  "prompt": "Help me build healthy habits that actually stick long-term, based on science and psychology, not just willpower.\n\nMY HABIT-BUILDING SITUATION:\n- Habit I want to build: [BE SPECIFIC - e.g., \"Exercise 30 min daily\" not just \"get fit\"]\n- Why this matters to me: [PERSONAL MOTIVATION - health, family, confidence, etc.]\n- Previous attempts: [WHAT I'VE TRIED BEFORE AND WHY IT FAILED]\n- Current routine: [DESCRIBE MY TYPICAL DAY/SCHEDULE]\n- Biggest obstacles: [LACK OF TIME / MOTIVATION / ENERGY / CONSISTENCY / FORGETFULNESS]\n- Success timeline: [WANT RESULTS IN 30 DAYS / 3 MONTHS / 1 YEAR]\n- Life situation: [BUSY PARENT / STUDENT / WORKER / RETIREE / etc.]\n- Personality: [PERFECTIONIST / PROCRASTINATOR / ALL-OR-NOTHING / GRADUAL CHANGER]\n\nCREATE MY HABIT-BUILDING PLAN:\n\n1. **HABIT FOUNDATION SETUP**\nMake success inevitable, not dependent on willpower:\n- Start ridiculously small (so small I can't say no)\n- Best time of day for this habit based on my schedule\n- Environmental design to make the habit easier\n- Trigger that will remind me to do the habit\n- How to attach this to an existing routine (habit stacking)\n\n2. **PSYCHOLOGICAL SUCCESS STRATEGIES**\nWork with my brain, not against it:\n- How to overcome the initial resistance\n- Identity-based approach (who I need to become)\n- Reward system that reinforces the habit\n- How to handle perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking\n- Mental reframes when I don't feel like doing it\n\n3. **WEEK-BY-WEEK PROGRESSION PLAN**\nScale up gradually without overwhelming myself:\n- Week 1-2: Minimum viable habit (build the routine first)\n- Week 3-4: Slight increase (still manageable)\n- Month 2: Adding complexity or duration\n- Month 3+: Full habit implementation\n- How to know when I'm ready to level up\n\n4. **OBSTACLE PREVENTION & SOLUTIONS**\nPlan for real-life challenges:\n- What to do when I'm sick, traveling, or stressed\n- How to restart after missing days (without guilt spirals)\n- Adapting the habit for busy/chaotic days\n- Dealing with family/friends who don't support the change\n- Emergency backup plans for my biggest obstacles\n\n5. **TRACKING & MOTIVATION SYSTEM**\nStay motivated without becoming obsessive:\n- Simple tracking method that works for me\n- Milestones to celebrate along the way\n- How to measure progress (not just completion)\n- When to reward myself and with what\n- Warning signs that I'm losing momentum\n\n6. **MAKING IT AUTOMATIC**\nMove from conscious effort to unconscious routine:\n- Signs that my habit is becoming automatic\n- How to strengthen the habit loop over time\n- Building habit consistency across different situations\n- Creating backup triggers for when life changes\n- Long-term maintenance strategies\n\n7. **COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID**\nLearn from others' mistakes:\n- Starting too big (and how to scale back)\n- Perfectionism traps that derail progress\n- Motivation vs. discipline balance\n- Social pressure and comparison issues\n- How to avoid the \"what the hell\" effect\n\n8. **HABIT STACKING & INTEGRATION**\nBuild multiple healthy habits systematically:\n- Which habit to focus on first (if I want multiple changes)\n- How to add a second habit without destroying the first\n- Creating morning and evening routine chains\n- Connecting habits to existing strong routines\n- Building a lifestyle around my new identity\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n- Base everything on behavioral science, not just motivation\n- Start smaller than I think I need to\n- Focus on consistency over intensity initially\n- Include specific plans for when I mess up (not if)\n- Make it work with my real life, not my ideal life\n- Address my specific personality and obstacles\n- Give me alternatives if my first approach doesn't work\n\nI'm tired of failing at building good habits. Help me create a system that works for someone who's struggled with consistency before, using proven psychology rather than just hoping willpower will be enough this time."
