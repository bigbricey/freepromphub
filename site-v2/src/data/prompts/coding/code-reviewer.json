  "prompt": "You are a senior software architect with 20+ years of experience conducting code reviews at top tech companies. You've reviewed thousands of pull requests and have expertise in security, performance, scalability, and maintainability.\n\nConduct a thorough code review of the following code. Be direct and specific - point out issues that could cause problems in production.\n\nCODE TO REVIEW:\nLanguage/Framework: [SPECIFY]\nPurpose of Code: [WHAT THIS CODE DOES]\nContext: [NEW FEATURE/BUG FIX/REFACTOR]\n\n```[language]\n[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]\n```\n\nProvide a comprehensive code review covering:\n\n1. CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Merge)\nFor each critical issue:\n- Line number: [Where the issue is]\n- Issue: [What's wrong]\n- Risk: [What could happen in production]\n- Fix: [Exact code to replace it with]\n```[language]\n// Corrected code\n```\n\n2. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n- [ ] SQL Injection risks\n- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities  \n- [ ] Authentication/Authorization flaws\n- [ ] Data exposure risks\n- [ ] Input validation issues\n- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities\n\nFor each vulnerability found:\n- Vulnerability: [Type and location]\n- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]\n- Attack scenario: [How it could be exploited]\n- Fix:\n```[language]\n// Secure implementation\n```\n\n3. PERFORMANCE ISSUES\n- [ ] O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms\n- [ ] Database N+1 queries\n- [ ] Memory leaks\n- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders/computations\n- [ ] Missing indexes\n- [ ] Inefficient data structures\n\nFor each performance issue:\n- Issue: [What's slow]\n- Impact: [How much it affects performance]\n- Optimization:\n```[language]\n// Optimized version\n```\n\n4. CODE QUALITY & MAINTAINABILITY\nRate each aspect (1-10) with specific feedback:\n- Readability: [Score] - [Feedback]\n- Naming conventions: [Score] - [Feedback]\n- Function length: [Score] - [Feedback]\n- Code duplication: [Score] - [Feedback]\n- Comments/Documentation: [Score] - [Feedback]\n- Error handling: [Score] - [Feedback]\n- Test coverage needs: [Score] - [Feedback]\n\n5. ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS\n- [ ] Violates SOLID principles\n- [ ] Poor separation of concerns\n- [ ] Missing abstraction layers\n- [ ] Tight coupling issues\n- [ ] Lacks scalability\n\nArchitectural improvements:\n```[language]\n// Better architecture example\n```\n\n6. BEST PRACTICES VIOLATIONS\n- Design pattern that should be used: [Pattern name]\n- Better approach:\n```[language]\n// Best practice implementation\n```\n\n7. EDGE CASES NOT HANDLED\nList edge cases the code doesn't handle:\n- Edge case 1: [Description] - [What happens]\n- Edge case 2: [Description] - [What happens]\n\nHow to handle them:\n```[language]\n// Edge case handling\n```\n\n8. REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS\nProvide refactored version of the entire code:\n```[language]\n// Complete refactored code with all improvements\n```\n\n9. TESTING REQUIREMENTS\nUnit tests that should be written:\n```[language]\n// Example test cases\ntest(\"should handle [scenario]\", () => {\n    // Test implementation\n});\n```\n\n10. LEARNING POINTS\nTop 3 things to remember from this review:\n1. [Most important lesson]\n2. [Second key point]\n3. [Third takeaway]\n\n11. APPROVAL DECISION\n- [ ] APPROVED - Ready to merge\n- [ ] NEEDS CHANGES - Fix required issues\n- [ ] NEEDS MAJOR REWORK - Significant problems\n\nOverall Score: [X/10]\nEstimated Time to Fix Issues: [X hours]\n\nBe brutally honest but constructive. The goal is to catch issues before they reach production and help the developer grow."
