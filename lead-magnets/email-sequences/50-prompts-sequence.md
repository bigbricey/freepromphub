## Email 2: The $10K Prompt Stack (Day 2)

**Subject Line:** The $10K/month prompt combination I discovered by accident

**Preview Text:** 5 prompts, used in this exact order, generated $10,400 last month

---

{{firstName}},

True story:

Last month I was helping a client automate her coaching business when we accidentally discovered something incredible...

By using 5 specific prompts from your collection IN A SPECIFIC ORDER, she created an automated system that generated $10,400 in 30 days.

Here's the exact stack:

**The $10K Prompt Stack:**

1. **Prompt #18** (Market Research) - Find desperate buyers in any niche
2. **Prompt #34** (Problem Extraction) - Identify their #1 painful problem  
3. **Prompt #42** (Solution Framework) - Create the perfect solution
4. **Prompt #27** (Sales Copy) - Write sales pages that convert at 7.2%
5. **Prompt #49** (Email Automation) - Set up the follow-up that closes deals

She used this stack to:
- Find a desperate market (overwhelmed course creators)
- Identify their biggest pain (can't finish their courses)
- Create a "done-in-a-weekend" course completion service
- Write a simple sales page
- Automate the entire fulfillment

**Result:** $10,400 in month one, now averaging $18K/month on autopilot.

Want to implement this yourself?

I'm doing a free 20-minute workshop tomorrow at 2pm EST showing the exact setup. No pitch, just pure value.

**[REGISTER FOR FREE WORKSHOP]**

Can't make it live? Register anyway and I'll send the replay.

Here's to your first $10K month,

P.S. The workshop is capped at 100 seats. We're already at 67 registered. Grab your spot now.

## Email 3: Case Study Deep Dive (Day 3)

**Subject Line:** [Case Study] From food stamps to $4,200 using prompt #37

**Preview Text:** Sarah's exact step-by-step process (she said I could share everything)

---

{{firstName}},

Sarah messaged me two months ago.

She was on food stamps, had $47 in her bank account, and her daughter needed school supplies.

"I downloaded your prompts but I don't know where to start. I'm desperate."

I told her to focus on ONE prompt: #37 (The Authority Builder).

Here's what happened next:

**Week 1:** She used prompt #37 to position herself as a "Mom Organization Expert" (she had zero credentials, just experience raising 3 kids)

**Week 2:** Used the prompt to create 10 pieces of authority content in 2 hours

**Week 3:** A corporate HR manager found her content, reached out about doing a "Working Mom Balance" workshop for their company

**Week 4:** Delivered the workshop (also created with prompt #37), got paid $4,200

**Today:** She's booked solid at $5K per workshop, turning down gigs

The crazy part?

Prompt #37 did 90% of the work. She just had to show up and deliver what the AI created.

Sarah gave me permission to share her exact templates, emails, and workshop slides.

**[DOWNLOAD SARAH'S COMPLETE BLUEPRINT]**

Three lessons from Sarah's success:

1. **One prompt used deeply beats 50 prompts used shallow**
2. **Authority can be manufactured in 48 hours with AI**
3. **Your experience is worth more than you think**

Which prompt will you master first?

To your transformation,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm creating a "Prompt #37 Mastermind" for 20 serious action-takers. We'll meet weekly to implement together. Interested? Just reply "MASTERMIND" and I'll send details.
